<h2 id="c2">PREFACE</h2>
<p>For more than a century the wild flowers of Texas have been a
source of study and pleasure to scientists and flower lovers. The
state can boast of a varied and interesting flora which has attracted
numerous plant collectors since the first specimens were collected in
the Texas Panhandle by Dr. Edwin James, naturalist accompanying
the Long Expedition in 1820. Dr. Louis Berlandier, a French botanist,
endured the hardships of the Teran Expedition for the exploration
of the boundary region between Texas and Mexico between
1826 and 1834 in order to collect plants in Texas.</p>
<p>Berlandier&rsquo;s first collection was instrumental, a few years later,
in arousing the interest of Thomas Drummond, a Scotch botanist
and collector. In 1833-34 Drummond visited Southeast Texas and
collected 700 species of plants. In 1836, Ferdinand Lindheimer, a
German botanist, moved to Texas and began his noteworthy study
and collection of Texas plants. Charles Wright, a Yale graduate,
came to Texas in 1837, first collecting plants in East Texas and later
making important additions in Southwest Texas. Since the work of
these early pioneers, many scientists have visited nearly all parts of
the state and have added many new names to the list of native
plants.</p>
<p>Today nearly five thousand species of flowering plants have been
reported from the state. About half of these have showy, conspicuous
flowers, and many of them are very limited in their distribution
in Texas. If the reader will keep these figures in mind, perhaps he
will not be disappointed at not finding some of his favorite flowers in
the following pages. As such a limited number could be included, it
was thought best to use those widely distributed throughout the
state, omitting some of the well-known plants which have been frequently
illustrated in previous publications.</p>
<p>The present manual is not intended as a guide to the flora of the
state, but it is hoped that it will prove helpful in identifying some
of the common flowers. A few rare and beautiful flowers have been
included so that they may be recognized and protected. In order to
include representatives of the more important plant families, it was
impossible because of lack of space to add many widely distributed
members of other families represented. For example, the pea family,
which has about 300 showy members in Texas, had to be limited to
ten representatives.</p>
<p>The water color paintings on which the manual is based were
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
made by the author. In nearly all cases they were made from fresh
specimens carefully checked with verified material in the University
of Texas Herbarium; a few which could not be painted at the
time of collecting were later drawn from pressed specimens and
colored from notes and memory.</p>
<p>The flowers of Texas have been so very abundant that only recently
has it been considered necessary to protect them. The Legislature
of 1933 passed a law forbidding the picking of flowers and
injury to trees and shrubs along highways. Even this protection is
not sufficient for some plants. A few years ago the writer happened
to visit the shop of a cactus fancier just after he had returned from
a collecting trip and saw with amazement the large tow-sacks filled
with rare and highly prized cacti. Wagon loads of the large and
vivid-blooming ribbed cacti have been observed as they were brought
in for market. The bluebell, or purple gentian, is in need of protection
since florists have been buying them up in such large quantities.
The picturesque bunches of sotol are being rapidly destroyed, as
ranchmen are stripping them of their saw-toothed leaves and feeding
the stalks to their cattle. Yaupon and American holly, both
slow-growing plants, are being destroyed to supply the market with
Christmas greens.</p>
<p>A few flower sanctuaries have been established in recent years, but
many others are needed. The decrease in our native flowers is primarily
due to increase in population with the accompanying increases
in homesteads and acres in cultivation, over-grazing, and improved
facilities of travel. The limestone hill region was formerly a
flower paradise but has been so heavily over-grazed by sheep in recent
years that now the only flowers to be found are the unattractive
rabbit-tobacco, horehound, and queen&rsquo;s delight, or goatweed, so
called because sheep and goats will not eat it.</p>
<p>Grateful acknowledgment is made to the many friends who have
assisted me in the preparation of this volume. I deeply regret that it
has been necessary to increase the list price of this edition. The first
edition of three thousand copies did not pay for the cost of publication.
That deficit, added to the increased costs of printing and
paper, have made an increase imperative.</p>

<h2 id="c4">PLANT PARTS AND PLANT NAMES</h2>
<p>The diagram on the <a href="#Page_xii">opposite page</a> carries illustrations of most of
the terms used in the following descriptions of plants. As it was intended
that this manual should serve as a means of plant identification
from illustrations, the descriptions have been made very brief.
If the reader is interested in a more detailed description, technical
books should be consulted. Some botanical terms are rather loosely
used in the effort to avoid technical expressions; for example, the
fruit of a daisy flower is known popularly as a seed but is an achene,
a seed closely covered by the wall of the ovary.</p>
<p>The conspicuous parts of the flower commonly make up the corolla,
each part being known as a petal; however, in some flowers the
showy part is actually the calyx, as the outer whorl of parts around
the stamens and pistil is always called. The divisions of the calyx are
known as sepals. The stamens are made up of two parts&mdash;the anthers
or small sacs which bear the pollen grains, a necessary part to
fertilization, and the filaments or stalks which elevate the anthers so
that the pollen grains can be scattered. The ovules which develop
into seeds after fertilization are borne in the ovary, a part of the
pistil. The pollen is deposited on the stigma and carried down the
style to the ovule. Showy flower parts, nectar, and other devices attract
insect visitors which aid in the transfer of pollen from one
flower to another.</p>
<p>In order that botanists everywhere may make use of plant names
and descriptions, these are written in Latin. The Latin name of the
bluebonnet is <i>Lupinus texensis</i>, in which <i>texensis</i> represents the
name of a species and <i>Lupinus</i> is the name of a genus, which is a
group of closely related species. The plants making up the different
species in a genus are usually so much alike in flower, fruit, and leaf
characters that they can be recognized as belonging to the same
group. Similar genera (plural of genus) are grouped together in
families; the family name in Latin takes the ending -<i>aceae</i>. Thus
while this book illustrates only 257 Texas plants, it is hoped that the
reader will become familiar with many others which bear a close
relationship.</p>
<p>Much effort has been expended to use scientific terminology in
accordance with that preferred by experts on various plant groups,
but continuing research changes many well known names. In this
list the name used in the text is followed by the name now in good
usage; the terms are not always synonymous. The authorities for
the names are not given but can be checked in technical publications.</p>

</div>
<p>The above map<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
gives the larger natural areas of the state. The
prairie regions afford the most profuse display of wild flowers. In the
wooded area of East Texas, the shortleaf pine is abundant in the
northern part, the loblolly in the southwestern part, and the longleaf
pine in the southeastern part of the area, while hardwoods are found
in the river bottoms. The chief trees in the post oak strip are post
oak and black jack oak. Among the mountain cedars, live oaks and
Spanish oaks, so common in the limestone hill region, may be found
scattered trees and shrubs of the chaparral. The chaparral region
is often broken by prairies but in some places is densely covered
with shrubs and small trees which are usually thorny. The mesquite
is abundant in this region and is more or less scattered throughout
the prairie regions.</p>

<h2 id="c6">DESCRIPTIONS OF SPECIES</h2>
<h3>WATER-PLANTAIN FAMILY (Alismaceae)</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p003.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="602" />
<p class="caption">SMALL ARROWHEAD<span class="hst"> LONG-LOBED ARROWHEAD</span></p>
</div>
<p class="bq">Marsh or water plants; leaves mostly basal; sepals 3; petals 3,
white or pink, tender; stamens 6 or more; pistils many, free;
fruit a head of achenes.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Small Arrowhead</span> (<i>Sagittaria papillosa</i>) is a common pond dweller
in Texas and Louisiana. Like other arrowheads the flowers are borne
in whorls, the upper having many stamens and the lower producing
the seeds. It may be distinguished from other narrow-leaved forms
by the rough (papillose) surface of the floral leaves.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Plains</span> or <span class="sc">Long-Lobed Arrowhead</span> (<i>Sagittaria longiloba</i>) is common
in shallow water on the plains from Nebraska to Mexico from April to
October. The shape of the leaf of this and other species has given the
common names of arrowhead and arrowleaf to this group. Like the
water-plantain and bur-head the flowers have 3 tender white petals.
The wapato duck potato (<i>S. latifolia</i>) may be found in East Texas.
Growing in great abundance along the coast, the water potato or
scythe-fruited arrowhead (<i>S. falcata</i>) is a showy plant 2-4 feet high
with large lance-shaped leaves. The tubers and young shoots of both
of these are considered excellent foods for ducks. Indians also
valued the starchy tubers for food, and it was the duty of the women
to grub in the mud for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h3>PINEAPPLE FAMILY (Bromeliaceae)</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p003a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="597" />
<p class="caption">SPANISH MOSS<span class="hst"> BALL MOSS</span></p>
</div>
<p class="bq">Chiefly air-plants, some rigid-leaved land plants; floral leaves
often conspicuous; 3 sepals; 3 petals; stamens 3-6; pistil 3-celled.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spanish Moss</span> (<i>Dendropogon usneoides</i>) has long zig-zag stems
hanging in gray masses from the branches of many trees, especially
live oaks, from the Coastal Plain of the United States to South America.
Sometimes called Florida-moss, wool crape, crape-moss, and long
moss, it has long been renowned in literature and industry. Indians
and pioneers found many uses for it, and it is still used for padding,
fodder for cattle, decoration, and the making of mattresses. The
short leaves are scattered on the slender stem, which may be 1-6 yards
long. The fragrant flowers are small and inconspicuous, being about
&frac14; inch long, blooming in early summer. The name means &ldquo;tree-beard.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ball Moss.</span> <span class="sc">Bunch Moss</span> (<i>Tillandsia recurvata</i>) has small and
inconspicuous purple flowers which appear in the summer. Like the
Spanish moss, it gets its nourishment from the air but may injure
trees by crowding out the leaves. Both mosses bear no relation to the
true mosses but belong to the same family as the pineapple. The ball
moss is found on trees, wires, rocks, and other places. Bailey&rsquo;s bunch
moss is a large-flowered form growing in the lower Rio Grande Valley.</p>

<h3>SPIDERWORT FAMILY (Commelinaceae)</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p004.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="598" />
<p class="caption">GIANT SPIDERWORT<span class="hst"> PRAIRIE SPIDERWORT</span></p>
</div>
<p class="bq">Mostly succulent herbs with tuberous or fibrous roots; flowers
arising from a cluster of leaf-like bracts; sepals 3; petals 3;
stamens 6; ovary 3-celled; fruit capsular.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Giant Spiderwort</span> (<i>Tradescantia gigantea</i>) grows in clumps of
stout stems 2-3 feet high. The numerous flowers on short slender
stalks hang out of a cluster of 2-3 upper leaves which have sac-like
bases, velvety with soft hairs. The 3-petaled flowers vary in color
from purplish-blue to rose or white and close at noon. The 6 stamens
are adorned with lovely violet hairs. It is found in Central Texas in
April and May.</p>
<p>The spiderwort group was named for Tradescant, gardener to
Charles I. It is well represented in Texas, all of the many different
species being easy to transplant and making attractive garden plants.
The wandering jew, a well-known spiderwort in cultivation, is a native
of South America.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Prairie Spiderwort</span> (<i>T. bracteata</i>) is a smaller plant with bluer
flowers. Ranging from Minnesota to Texas, it has its blooming season
in Texas in April and May.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<div class="img" id="fig6">

<p class="caption">TEXAS DAYFLOWER<span class="hst"> WIDOW&rsquo;S TEARS</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Curly-Leaved Dayflower.</span> <span class="sc">Widow&rsquo;s Tears</span> (<i>Commelina crispa</i>)
has two large blue petals and a third, minute, white, and inconspicuous.
The upper three stamens are 4-lobed and sterile, quite different from
the 3 lower pollen-producing stamens, one of which is larger than the
others. The petals are very tender and last only one morning. This
dayflower may be distinguished from several others in the state by its
crisped leaf-margins. It is very common on the South Central Plains
from May to September. The name is given in honor of early Dutch
botanists by the name of Commelyn.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Texas Dayflower</span> (<i>Commelinantia anomala</i>) has two large petals
like the dayflowers, but may be distinguished from them by their
lavender color and by having the leaf around the flower-cluster more
like the lower leaves in shape. The three upper stamens are bearded
with violet hairs like those of spiderworts. It grows in rich moist soil
in the limestone hills of the southern part of the state and the adjoining
part of Mexico.</p>

<h3>PICKEREL-WEED FAMILY (Pontederiaceae)</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig7">

<p class="caption">WATER HYACINTH</p>
</div>
<p class="bq">Aquatic plants; leaves alternate, often basal; sepals 3, petal-like;
petals 3, sepals and petals partly united; ovary 3-celled.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Water Hyacinth</span> (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) is also called wampee,
river raft, and water orchid. It grows so thick in places that water
channels may be blocked, and island-like masses may serve as rafts.
With its large spikes of lavender flowers and its broad shining leaves
with their curious bulbous floats, it is the queen of our water plants.
Many streams, lakes, and canals along the coastal highway offer living
pictures which will not soon fade from the memory. The plants float
by means of the bulbous enlargement of the leaf stalk. The flowers
are somewhat 2-lipped, the 3 sepals and 3 petals somewhat alike but
with a yellow spot on the upper petal.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pickerel Weed</span> (<i>Pontedaria cordata</i>) may be found growing in the
mud of inland waters along the coast. It is a taller plant than the
water hyacinth, the spikes are narrower, the flowers are a deeper
purple, and the leaves are narrower and have no float.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3>LILY FAMILY (Liliaceae)</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p005a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="606" />
<p class="caption">NUTTALL&rsquo;S DEATH CAMASS<span class="hst"> WILD HYACINTH</span></p>
</div>
<p class="bq">Aquatic plants; leaves alternate, often basal; sepals 3, petal-like;
petals 3, sepals and petals partly united; ovary 3-celled.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nuttall&rsquo;s Death Camass</span> (<i>Toxicoscordion nuttallii</i>) is a common
prairie bunch-flower from Texas to Tennessee and Kansas. The leaves,
which are mainly basal, long, narrow, and curved, and the stout stems
1-2 feet high arise from a large black-coated bulb which is poisonous.
Many cream-colored flowers are borne in a round-topped cluster. The
3 sepals and 3 petals are alike, and the 6 stamens have large yellow
anthers. The 3-beaked capsules have numerous seeds. The flowers
bloom in April and May. The poisonous bulb is responsible for the
name, which is derived from the Greek meaning &ldquo;poison-onion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wild Hyacinth</span> (<i>Quamasia hyacinthina</i>) is also called indigo-squill
or meadow hyacinth. Growing from a deep-rooted edible bulb, a
slender stalk 1-2 ft. high bears a spike-like cluster of hyacinth-blue
flowers at the top. The flowers are about &frac12; inch broad and have a
most delightful fragrance. It is widespread from Pennsylvania to
Texas, common in Texas along railroads in April.</p>

<p class="caption">PRAIRIE ONION<span class="hst"> CROW POISON</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Prairie Onion</span> (<i>Allium nuttallii</i>) has short flower stalks 4-6 inches
high growing from a very small bulb which has a brown, finely-woven
outer coat. The flowers are nearly half an inch broad and vary from
pale pink to a deep rose. <i>Allium</i> is the Latin for &ldquo;garlic,&rdquo; and both the
cultivated garlic and onion are members of this group. There are
nearly twenty different wild onions in the state, many of which make
lovely garden plants. <i>Allium mutabile</i>, a taller onion with very numerous

<p><span class="sc">Beargrass.</span> <span class="sc">Fine-Leaved Tree-Yucca</span> (<i>Yucca elata</i>) belongs to a
group widely represented in Texas by many different forms, those with
thin thready leaves being known as beargrass, soapweed, &ldquo;palmillo,&rdquo;
and Adam&rsquo;s needle and those with thick, stiff, sharp-pointed leaves as
Spanish bayonet or dagger. All have creamy or greenish-white bell-shaped
drooping flowers borne in dense clusters on a long stalk growing
out of a rosette of leaves. The fine-leaved tree-yucca sometimes grows
20 ft. high and is very abundant west of the Pecos River to Arizona.
The budding flower stalk is quite tender and palatable and was often
used as a food by early settlers. It is an excellent food for cattle, and
they keep the stalks stripped of budding shoots, making the absence
of seed pods quite conspicuous on the cattle ranges. Indians used the
leaf fibers for making sandals.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Soapweed</span> (<i>Yucca glauca</i>), the common yucca of the Panhandle of
Texas and adjacent states, has an unbranched flower stalk. As in
other yuccas, the roots yield soap when the bark is removed and
crushed in water. The fruits of the stiff-leaved tree-yuccas are edible.</p>

a large black-coated bulb; they are about a foot long and nearly half
an inch wide. Shortly after heavy rains in spring and early summer,
lawns, meadows, and woods in Louisiana, Texas, and Mexico are covered
with the lovely blossoms. It is also called prairie lily, field lily,
crow poison, and fairy lily.</p>

bane of ranchmen, for it is poisonous to cattle.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Carolina Larkspur</span> (<i>Delphinium carolinianum</i>) commonly has
lovely deep blue flowers, though white forms may be found. It is
very abundant in East Texas in March and April, growing 1&frac12;-2 ft.
high. The plants have few leaves, and these are 3-5 parted, each part
being divided into narrow linear lobes. It is very much like the Texas
larkspur (<i>Delphinium vimineum</i>), which has blue or white flowers,
grows taller, and is more leafy than the Carolina larkspur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delphinium&rdquo; is derived from the Latin meaning &ldquo;dolphin,&rdquo; so-called
because of the resemblance of the spurred flowers to a dolphin.
The common garden larkspur is native to Southern Europe. Some
of the larkspurs furnish drugs.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Large Buttercup</span> (<i>Ranunculus macranthus</i>) has handsome, golden-yellow
flowers about 2 in. broad. There are 10-15 broad yellow petals
which are longer than the sepals and have a nectar pit at their base.
The leaves are mainly basal, long-stalked, and divided into wedge-shaped
lobes. It ranges from Central to Southwestern Texas and is
most abundant in April. It is a plant which does well in cultivation
but requires plenty of water; it blooms in the shade better than most
garden plants.</p>
<p>Many of the buttercups grow in marshy places, a fact which is
responsible for the old Latin name meaning &ldquo;little frog.&rdquo; Many different
kinds are found along roadside ditches and in marshy places in
East Texas. Some members of the crowfoot family, including the
wood-anemone and the marsh marigold, common in the Northern
States but not native to Texas, yield poisonous honey.</p>

is a vine growing in great profusion, covering shrubs and
fences from Central Texas to Arizona and Mexico. The 4 petal-like
sepals are pale greenish-yellow, almost white, narrow and thin with
margins somewhat crinkled, about &frac12; in. long. The flowers bloom in
the summer, being inconspicuous among the branching leafy stems.
The stamen-bearing flowers are on a separate vine from the seed-producing
flowers. The seeds mature in a few weeks, and soon the
vine is covered with iridescent masses of silky, feathery plumes, 2-4
in. long, which grow out from the seed cover. These plumes are
elongated, persistent styles and are responsible for many common
names given to the vine, including grandfather&rsquo;s beard, gray beard,
goat&rsquo;s beard, and love-in-the-mist.</p>

rounded. This clematis is a hardy climber, well known in cultivation,
giving rise to many hybrids when crossed with the marsh leather
flower (<i>Clematis crispa</i>), which is a low climber, 3-4 ft. high, with
lavender bell-shaped flowers. The leather flowers have no petals, the

The thick gray-green leaves are divided into three leaflets which have
3-7 lobes ending in sharp spines. The stiff spreading branches form a
compact shrub 4-5 feet high.</p>
<p>The clusters of fragrant flowers are among the first spring blossoms
to appear in late February and March. With 6 spreading yellow
sepals and 6 yellow petals forming a cup around the stamens and
pistil, the small flowers are somewhat like those of the narcissus. The
acid berries ripen in May and June, being used for jellies and wines;
the flowers are an important source of nectar; and the wood and roots
furnish a yellow dye which was used by Indians and pioneers.</p>
<p><span class="sc">May Apple.</span> <span class="sc">Mandrake</span> (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>) is abundant in

<p><span class="sc">Moonseed Vine</span> (<i>Cebatha Carolina</i>) is a vine with clusters of small
red berries. It is very abundant throughout the state in woods and
on fences, ranging north to Kansas and Virginia. It is also called
coral-bead, margil, coral-vine, and red-berried moonseed. &ldquo;Cebatha,&rdquo;
from the Greek, alludes to its climbing habit, while &ldquo;moonseed&rdquo; refers
to the curved seed of the fleshy red berries which ripen in the fall and
remain on the vines long after the leaves have fallen. The small white
flowers bloom during the summer and fall. The leaves are quite variable,
sometimes entire and sometimes distinctly 3-lobed and rarely
5-lobed, being smooth above and downy beneath.</p>
<p>The berries of the Indian moonseed contain an acrid poison which is

<p><span class="sc">Rose Prickly Poppy</span> (<i>Argemone rosea</i>) is one of the loveliest flowers
of South Texas. It is very abundant along the Rio Grande, extending
into Mexico and northward almost to San Antonio. The large flowers
vary in color from pale pink to rose and purple-rose and are more
cup-shaped than the white-flowered species. It has gray-green leaves
conspicuously blotched with white along the midribs, the slightly wavy
margins being armed with sharp spines. Like other prickly poppies,
the flowers have 6 petals, the 3 outer a little different in shape from
the 3 inner, and an orange-colored sap. Long considered a variety of
the western prickly poppy (<i>Argemone platyceras</i>), which has very
spiny leaves and stems and white flowers, it may readily be separated
because of its seed-pods, which are about 2 in. long and decidedly
broader above the middle.</p>
<p><i>Argemone</i> is from the Greek meaning an eye disease, supposedly
cured by the plant. The opium poppy (<i>Papaver somniferum</i>) has
been widely planted in gardens, and has escaped in places in the state.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rough-Stemmed</span> or <span class="sc">White Prickly Poppy</span> (<i>Argemone hispida</i>)
is a bushy, leafy-stemmed plant growing about 2-3 ft. high. It is
distinguished from several other very abundant white-flowered poppies
by the fact that it has rough hairs as well as spines on the stem.
The flowers as a rule are larger, often being 4-6 inches broad. The
unusual sepals of the prickly poppies should be noted, as they sometimes
cause the flower buds to be confused with the fruits. There
are usually 3 sepals, which are horned or hooded, armed with spines,
and snugly overlapping each other by a narrow margin. In the rough-stemmed
prickly poppy the horns are large and triangular in shape.
It ranges from Texas to Kansas and California.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Texas Prickly Poppy</span> (<i>Argemone delicatula</i>) is not so branched
or leafy and has flowers somewhat smaller, 2&frac12;-3 in. broad. The stigmas

fig, flowering or Jamaica thistle, and Mexican thorn poppy. It has
smaller flowers than the white and rose prickly poppies. It blooms
in Texas in March and April and throughout the summer if the stems
are cut. For cut flowers, the stems should be burned immediately upon
gathering; otherwise the flowers soon wither.</p>
<p>The seeds of the Mexican poppy are valued for the painter&rsquo;s oil

it is placed in the <i>Corydalis</i> group, which was named because of the
resemblance of the flower spur to that of a lark. The pods are about
an inch long, and the seeds are black, smooth, and shining. The short-podded
scrambled-eggs (<i>Capnoides crystallinum</i>) comes into the northern

with inconspicuous flowers, but all having the small, flat, roundish
seed-pod which is usually notched above. The foliage and pods have
an aromatic-peppery flavor. In some species the leaves are used for
salad and the seeds for bird food, but the seeds from some native
species have been fed to canaries with fatal results.</p>

about half an inch long, erect or ascending. The flowers are small,
the petals yellow. In the southern part of the state it is very abundant
and grows 2-3 ft. high. The name was given because of medicinal
properties accredited to the plant.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Slender Bladder-Pod.</span> <span class="sc">Cloth-of-Gold</span> (<i>Lesquerella gracilis</i>) can be
recognized by its bladder-like pods, which are responsible for its common

streaked with orange. The first flush of yellow on plains and prairies
is usually due to the bladder-pods. There are more than 20 species in
the state, most of them being very abundant. The scientific name is
in honor of Leo Lesquereux, a Swiss and American botanist.</p>
<p>The western wall-flower (<i>Erysimum asperum</i>), which grows in

the stigmas and occupying the center of the flower. The other names
refer to the tubular, ribbed, trumpet-shaped leaves. The flowers are
drooping at maturity, with 5 fiddle-shaped yellow petals and 5 shorter
yellow sepals tinged with brown or red. It grows in swamps from
East Texas to Alabama and is quite similar to the eastern <i>Sarracenia
flava</i>. April-May.</p>
<p>The pitcher-plant is a most efficient collector of insects. The upper
part of the leaf bends over, forming a lid whose inner surface is covered
with minute honey-glands attractive to insects. The upper part of the
tube is smooth, affording little foothold and causing the insect to fall
into and drown in the sticky fluid given off in the lower part of the
tube. Downwardly directed hairs prevent his escape. After a time his
body is dissolved and absorbed by the plant. An overdose of animal
food causes the browning and decay of the leaves.</p>

The prairie stonecrop grows in dry, open places from Missouri
to Texas and blooms from April to June. It makes an excellent
carpeting plant when used in sunny places.</p>
<p>The stonecrop belongs to a large group of plants, including live-forever

rockeries. Wright&rsquo;s stonecrop (<i>Sedum wrightii</i>) is a white-flowered
plant, very much like the prairie stonecrop, found in the mountains in
the western part of the state, New Mexico, and Mexico. Sedum is
from the Latin meaning &ldquo;to sit&rdquo; and refers to the low growth habit.
In the same family are included the house-leeks, some of which are
known as hen-and-chickens, or old-man-and-woman, because of the detached

4-8 in. long, soon turning pale yellow, mature in a few weeks. The
leaves have 2 or 4 widely spreading divisions and commonly bear
6-15 pairs of leaflets about 1 in. long.</p>
<p>Like the huisache, the mesquite has many uses. The beans are
edible, the pulp containing 25-30 per cent grape sugar. The Indians
used the beans for a food, first grinding them into meal in holes in
the rocks. They form a valuable stock food in Hawaii, where the trees
have been introduced. The wood is hard and takes an excellent polish,
but is chiefly used for fence-posts, railroad ties, fuel, and paving
blocks. The honey produced from the flowers is not so good as
huisache honey nor is so much produced.</p>

<p class="caption">PINK SENSITIVE BRIAR</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Pink Sensitive Briar</span> (<i>Leptoglottis uncinata</i>) is also called pink
mimosa and shame-vine, the latter name being given because of the
leaf&rsquo;s habit of closing when touched. The vines sprawl on the ground,
growing out 2-4 ft. They are densely covered with small, recurved
prickles. The leaves are divided as in other mimosas, having 4-8
pairs of divisions each bearing 8-15 pairs of short leaflets. The small,
fragrant pink flowers are borne in dense heads. The pods are nearly
round, densely covered with spines, and about 1&frac12; in. long. It grows
in dry soil from Virginia to Mexico, blooming in Texas in April and
May.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Yellow Sensitive Briar</span> (<i>Neptunia lutea</i>) is very much like the
pink briar but has oblong heads of yellow flowers. The pods are
smooth and flat and markedly narrowed at the base. The yellow briar

<p class="bq">Trees, shrubs, or rarely herbs; leaves usually once or twice
pinnate; flowers mostly showy; sepals 5; petals 5; stamens mostly
10; ovary 1-celled; fruit a pod.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Texas Redbud</span> (<i>Cercis reniformis</i>) is one of the handsomest shrubs
of the limestone hill region of Texas and New Mexico. The pea-shaped
flowers appear on last year&rsquo;s wood in February or March, often
remaining lovely for a month before the leaves appear. The leaves are
a glossy green above, rounded and sometimes deeply notched or
kidney-shaped (reniform), and usually 3-4 in. broad. The clusters of
numerous red seed-pods are very conspicuous in the summer and autumn.
The flat pods have a narrow wing on one side and are pointed
at both ends, 2&frac12;-3 in. long and over &frac12; in. broad.</p>
<p>The Canadian or eastern redbud is found in the northern and eastern
part of the state. It has smaller flowers and very pointed leaves.
The western redbud grows in the mountainous region of the state and
has similar leaves but smaller flowers.</p>
<p>The Asiatic redbud is called Judas-tree because Judas is supposed
to have hanged himself from one of the trees. Redbud flowers, served
either fried or pickled for salads, are sometimes eaten by people. It
is an excellent shrub or small tree for highway and garden planting.</p>

<p class="caption">TWO-LEAVED SENNA</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Two-Leaved Senna</span> (<i>Cassia roemeriana</i>) gets its common name from
the two spreading leaflets into which the leaf is divided. They are
1-2 in. long and have a slender stalk about the same length. The
stems are commonly about 8-12 in. high, growing from a woody perennial
root. The sparsely-flowered clusters of yellow flowers appear
from spring until fall. The seed-pods are about an inch long and
half an inch wide. This senna is very abundant from Central Texas
into Mexico and New Mexico. It bears the name of Roemer, a
geologist sent from Germany to study the geology of the grant made
to the German colonists at New Braunfels. He was in Texas from
1845 to 1847, visited and botanized with Lindheimer at New Braunfels,
and carried many new Texas plants back to Germany.</p>
<p>The senna group is very large and mainly tropical in distribution,
many species being noted for medicinal properties. The coffee senna
(<i>Cassia occidentalis</i>) and the American senna (<i>Cassia marilandica</i>)
are common weeds in the eastern part of the state. The velvet-leaved
or Lindheimer&rsquo;s senna grows in the western part of the state.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Partridge Pea.</span> <span class="sc">Prairie Senna</span> (<i>Chamaecrista fasciculata</i>) is also
called large-flowered sensitive pea, dwarf cassia, and magoty-boy-bean.
It blooms in the summer months and is very abundant in sandy soil
in Central and Eastern Texas, ranging to Mexico and the northern
part of the United States. The oblong leaves have 8-14 pairs of linear
leaflets and a conspicuous orange or brown gland near the base. The
flowers have five yellow petals, somewhat unequal and irregular in
shape. Several buds grow on a short stalk between the leaves, but
usually only one flower on the stalk opens at a time. It is an erect
annual plant growing about 2&frac12; feet high and often widely branched
above. The pods are flattened, about &frac14; in. wide and 2 in. long.</p>
<p>Several shrubs of the senna family are popular in Texas gardens,
among them the bird-of-paradise (<i>Poinciana gilliesii</i>). It is a South
American plant with showy yellow flowers which have 10 long brilliant
red stamens protruding 3-5 inches from the flower.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Retama.</span> <span class="sc">Horse Bean</span> (<i>Parkinsonia aculeata</i>) is also known as
Jerusalem-thorn, shower-of-gold, and palo verde, the latter meaning
&ldquo;green timber&rdquo; from the green trunk and branches. It forms a spiny
shrub or small tree with long, graceful, somewhat drooping branches,
bearing bundles of leaves and sprays of yellow flowers. The long
divided leaves are somewhat unusual. The leaf-stalks are green,
broad, and flattened, performing the functions of the small leaflets
which often drop off quite early. The 5 yellow petals are almost
equal, but one bears a honey gland at its base and soon becomes red,
remaining on the stalk longer than the others. The pods are 3-5 in.
long, very narrow and constricted between the seeds. It ranges from
Central Texas to Mexico and tropical America, bearing a profusion
of blooms through the warm months after rains.</p>
<p>Besides being a very ornamental shrub of value in landscaping, the
plant has various other uses. The seeds are edible and have long been
used as food by Indians, Mexicans, and many animals. Mrs. Quillin,
author of <i>Texas Wild Flowers</i>, reports the use in the treatment of diabetes
of a tea the Mexicans make from the branches and leaves.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Prairie Sand-Bur.</span> <span class="sc">Linear-Leaved Krameria</span> (<i>Krameria lanceolata</i>)
is not the sand-bur of the grass family with which all children of
the South are familiar; however, the burs are just as spiny, but are
densely covered with white hairs. The flowers and short silky leaves
grow on prostrate branches from a thick woody root. The 5 wine-red
sepals may be mistaken for the petals which are smaller than the
sepals and tinged with green, the 3 upper being united. The flowers
are about an inch broad. The plant is not conspicuous but is quite
abundant in dry, rocky soil from Kansas to Mexico, blooming from
April to June.</p>
<p>Several shrubby kramerias grow in the southwestern part of the
state. The name is in honor of an Austrian physician, Johann Kramer.
Medicinal properties are reported for some of the species.</p>
<p>Chacate (<i>Kameria grayi</i>) is a densely branched shrub, 1-3 ft. high,
with purple flowers. The bark of the root is used by Mexicans in
dyeing leather a reddish-brown. It is found in the mountains of West

<p><span class="sc">Texas Mountain Laurel</span> (<i>Sophora secundiflora</i>) is an evergreen
shrub or small tree growing on limestone hillsides from Texas to New
Mexico and Mexico; it is particularly abundant in Southwest-Central
Texas. The dense clusters of violet-blue flowers, at their best in the
latter part of March but blooming earlier or later in different sections,
are very showy against the glossy dark-green, leathery leaves. Many
variations in color exist in nature from dark violet-blue to violet-tinged
and white. The flowers have a strong, heavy scent which is disagreeable
to most people. The brilliant scarlet beans, which mature in a
few weeks, contain a poisonous alkaloid.</p>
<p>The Texas mountain laurel is not at all related to the southern
mountain laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>), a rose-flowered shrub of the heath
family. The sophoras have retained the Arabian name and include
in their group many handsome ornamental shrubs, among which is
the Japan pagoda tree. The Texas sophora can be readily grown
from seed but is seldom successfully transplanted.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bush Pea.</span> <span class="sc">Large-Bracted False Indigo</span> (<i>Baptisia bracteata</i>) is
sometimes called hen-and-chickens pea from the growth habit of the
plant. The clusters of cream-colored flowers grow downward and
peep out from the bushy leaf-growth. The flowers are about 1 in.
long, and the 3 gray-green leaflets are 1-3 in. long. It grows on sandy
slopes or moist prairies from the eastern part of Texas to Minnesota
and South Carolina, blooming in Texas in April.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Texas Bluebonnet</span> (<i>Lupinus texensis</i>) (see <a href="#Page_i">frontispiece</a>) was widely
known in pioneer days as buffalo clover. It grows in great abundance
on limestone hillsides between the Brazos and Pecos Rivers from Dallas
southward into Mexico. Seed-houses sell the Texas bluebonnet under
the name of <i>Lupinus subcarnosus</i>, the bluebonnet of sandy areas. It
has narrower flower spikes and rounded leaf-tips. Several other lupines
are found in Texas but are not very common. The name is from the
Latin meaning &ldquo;wolf,&rdquo; because it was thought the plants ruined the
fertility of the soil. On the contrary, the lupines are excellent fertilizers,
as the small nodules on the roots contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria
which add to the soil nitrates. It blooms from March to early
May. The bluebonnet was adopted as the state flower in 1901.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Indigo-Plant.</span> <span class="sc">Scarlet Pea</span> (<i>Indigofera leptosepala</i>) has prostrate
branches growing from a woody root. The short, erect spikes of scarlet,
pea-shaped flowers are borne near the ends of the branches, blooming
from early spring until late summer, their blossoms forming an ever-increasing
scarlet circle after each rain. The leaves are divided into
5-9 leaflets, narrowed at the base and about half an inch long. A
small amount of indigo may be extracted from the foliage. While
this is not a very conspicuous plant, it is one of the most widely distributed
in the state and ranges to Mexico, Kansas, and Florida.</p>
<p>The indigo-plant belongs to a large group, mostly tropical, and
many species, as the name indicates, are indigo-bearing. Commercial
indigo, now a coal-tar product, was formerly obtained from a shrub
(<i>Indigofera tinctoria</i>) introduced for cultivation into South Carolina
in 1742. Several shrubby species of indigo-plants are found in the
state, but none of them are very abundant.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Golden Parosela</span> or <span class="sc">Dalea</span> (<i>Parosela aurea</i>) may not be recognized
at first glance as a member of the pea family, since the flowers grow
in dense clusters at the top of erect branches, 1-1&frac12; ft. high, which
grow from a thick, woody root. The yellow flowers are small and
pea-shaped, with a calyx which has slender, silky-plumose lobes. It
may be found on chalky slopes of prairies from Texas to Missouri and
South Dakota in June and July.</p>
<p>Several shrubby paroselas, very handsome when in full bloom, are

<p><span class="sc">Larger Ground Plum</span> (<i>Geoprumnon mexicanum</i>) blooms with the
first flowers of spring, forming conspicuous clumps on prairies from
Illinois to Nebraska and Texas. The spreading prostrate branches
grow 6-12 in. long and are covered with spike-like clusters of pale-purple
flowers. The fleshy pods soon turn red and plum-like, maturing
several weeks after flowering. The pods are edible and may be found
in prairie-dog holes among the foods these animals have stored for
the winter.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Loco Weeds</span> are closely related to the ground plum, two of them
being found in Texas and causing much loss to stockmen. They cause
a slow poisoning of horses, sheep, and cattle but are particularly injurious
to horses. The poisoning is chiefly due to the barium salts in
the plant and is characterized by symptoms of staggering, some paralysis,
and emaciation. The woolly loco weed (<i>Astragalus mollissimus</i>)
has woolly leaves with 19-27 oval leaflets about half an inch long and
spikes of violet-purple flowers. The stemless loco weed (<i>Oxytropis
lamberti)</i> has basal leaves with 9-19 nearly linear leaflets about an
inch long. Both are common on the plains, but the latter ranges into
Southern Canada.</p>

late March and April, the plants forming masses of bloom along
roadsides in the sandy regions of the state from Central Texas to
Arkansas and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Many of the climbing vetches are planted for cover crops, and one

May, and ranges to Arizona and Southern Canada. It may grow
1-2 ft. high, but in Texas it is often only about 8 in. high.</p>
<p>This flax is very much like the European perennial flax (<i>Linum

<p><span class="sc">Pink</span> or <span class="sc">Bitter Milkwort</span> (<i>Polygala polygama</i>) is a showy-flowered
milkwort growing in sandy woods in East Texas. It has erect branches
with slender clusters of pink flowers about &frac14; in. long and horizontal
branches under the soil bearing closed flowers which are self-fertilized.
It blooms in Texas in April.</p>
<p><span class="sc">White Milkwort</span> (<i>Polygala alba</i>) has densely-flowered spikes of
greenish-white flowers, the buds often tinged with purple. A drug
obtained from the dried root is used as an irritant. Like the closely
related Seneca snake-root (<i>Polygala senega</i>), it probably contains
saponin, which will dissolve the red blood-corpuscles. The roots of
the latter are used in medicine to produce vomiting and as an antidote
for snake-bite. The white milkwort is common on prairies and chalky
slopes from Montana to Mexico from April to July.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Purple Milkwort</span> (<i>Polygala puberula</i>) grows in the mountains of
West Texas, Arizona, and Mexico. It has much larger seed capsules
than the two preceding. The capsule is one of the chief features for
identifying the milkworts, being 2-celled and flattened.</p>

<p class="caption">BULL NETTLE</p>
</div>
<p class="bq">Flowers staminate and pistillate, often borne in an involucre;
sepals sometimes reduced or absent; petals usually absent; stamens
1 to 1,000; styles free or united at base; fruit usually a
3-lobed capsule.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bull Nettle</span> (<i>Cnidoscolus texanus</i>), also called tread-softly, spurge-nettle,
and &ldquo;mala mujer&rdquo; (bad woman), is a vicious plant thickly
clothed with stinging hairs and bearing clusters of tubular white
flowers quite similar to the tuberose in appearance and fragrance.
The plants grow 2-3 ft. high. The upper flowers bear stamens, and
the flowers in the lower forks of the cluster produce seeds. The seed-capsules
resemble those of other members of the spurge family in
being nearly ball-shaped and deeply three-lobed. The seeds are large,
edible, and very palatable. The plants are very abundant in waste
places and sandy soil from Texas to Arkansas and Oklahoma, blooming
from late spring until fall.</p>
<p>Some familiar commercial products are obtained from members of
the spurge family; e.g., rubber, tapioca, and castor oil. In horticulture,
the cactus-like spurges and the Christmas poinsettia are well-known
favorites. The Chinese tallow-tree (<i>Sapium sebiferum</i>) is used as an
ornamental tree, its leaves being very decorative in the fall.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Snow-on-the-Mountain.</span> <span class="sc">Ghost-Weed</span> (<i>Euphorbia bicolor</i>) grows
in great abundance on the plains of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana,
and Texas, being especially thick along dry creek margins. The plants
are lovely in late August and September, their showy appearance being
due to the green and white leaves surrounding the flower clusters.
It bears rather unusual flowers which yield a poisonous honey. The
green calyx-like structure is an involucre bearing numerous flowers,
each consisting of a single stamen or pistil. Around the top of the
involucre are 4-5 small glands each bearing a white appendage which
is mistaken for the petals. The cultivated snow-on-the-mountain
(<i>Euphorbia marginata</i>) has broader and shorter leaves. It is native
on hillsides of Central Texas north to Minnesota.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Texas Croton</span> (<i>Croton texensis</i>) is a weed, 2-3 ft. high, growing in
conspicuous masses, particularly in the western part of the state. The
flowers are inconspicuous among the gray-green foliage, the widely
branched stems bearing numerous linear leaves. The fragrant leaves
and stems from some of the crotons are gathered and dried by the
Mexicans to use for tea or meat seasoning.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Yaupon.</span> <span class="sc">Cassine</span> (<i>Ilex vomitoria</i>) with dark glossy evergreen
leaves and red berries forms lovely hedges along the highways and
fields and is scattered through woods in Central and East Texas,
ranging to Virginia. The berries, an excellent bird food, usually remain
on the shrubs until the small white flowers appear in late March
or April. The plant forms a dense widely-branched shrub, which is
of slow growth and very desirable for hedges. As the berries are produced
on separate bushes from the pollen-bearing flowers, care should
be taken to plant those producing berries if ornamental shrubs are
desired. Cassine tea is made from the leaves, but it is bitter and contains
much caffein and tannin. Like the American holly, which grows
in East Texas, the yaupon is being exterminated for Christmas decorations.
The deciduous holly (<i>Ilex decidua</i>) has larger leaves, which are
shed in the early fall, and larger orange-red berries, which remain on
the shrub or tree until late winter.</p>

seeds large, shining.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Southern Buckeye</span> (<i>Aesculus discolor</i>) is a handsome shrub or
small tree with showy spike-like clusters of deep red or yellow flowers.
The yellow-flowered shrub formerly known as <i>Aesculus octandra</i> is now
called variety <i>flavescens</i>. The finely-toothed leaves are a glossy dark
green above and whitish beneath. The red flowers have a red tubular
calyx and 4 red petals, and the yellow variety has all-yellow flowers.
Seldom more than 2 large brown seed develop in the 3-lobed leathery
capsule.</p>
<p>The seeds and young shoots of buckeyes are usually considered
poisonous, those of the horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>) being
especially so. Soap may be obtained from the roots and a black dye
from the wood.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Western Buckeye</span> (<i>Aesculus arguta</i>) is a yellow-flowered buckeye
with leaves divided into 7-9 leaflets. It is found along streams in the
western part of the state north to Iowa and Missouri. The buckeyes
bloom in March or April. They shed their leaves quite early in the
fall and are conspicuous in the winter because of their large buds.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Indian Mallow</span> (<i>Abutilon incanum</i>) is a much branched plant,
commonly 2-4 ft. tall, with rather small ovate leaves, and yellow
flowers nearly an inch across. It is a profuse bloomer in the summer
and fall. Like other abutilons, it is sometimes called flowering maple
because of the maple-like leaves, and may be easily recognized by the
seed-capsules, which are about &frac12; inch high and divided into 7-9 cells.
The flowers are typical of the mallow group, having 5 separate petals
and numerous stamens united in a tube around the styles. The
plants grow in dry soil from Arkansas to Mexico and Arizona.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Large-Flowered Sida</span> (<i>Sida texana</i>) is a common perennial plant
in the sandy regions of South Texas. The slender, erect stems bear a
few linear-oblong leaves, paler below, and long slender-stalked flowers.
The flowers are pale orange-yellow and have the irregularly-lobed
petals characteristic of the sidas.</p>
<p>The mallow family includes the commercial plants cotton and okra,
and numerous ornamentals, such as hibiscus, hollyhock, and althea.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Copper Mallow</span> (<i>Sph&aelig;ralcea pedatifida</i>) is often confused with the
following mallow, but may be distinguished by its thin leaves clothed
with a few star-shaped hairs, the 3 linear leaves (bractlets) under the
calyx, and the seed capsules, which have one seed in each division
completely filling the cell. Both have upper leaves divided into 5
parts and lower leaves into 3 parts. This plant is a low, spreading
perennial which forms clumps about 1&frac12; ft. broad. It grows in sandy
or gravelly soil, Southwestern Texas, in April and May. Several
copper mallows are very abundant in the Southwest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Red Star-Mallow</span> (<i>Malvastrum coccineum</i>) also has star-shaped
hairs on the leaves, but they are very dense and give the leaves a
gray, scurfy appearance. The cells are usually 1-seeded with an empty
terminal portion above. The plant is also called prairie mallow, red
false mallow, and rose moss. It grows in low clumps, spreading or
erect, on prairies from Texas to Southern Canada and blooms from
May to August.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mexican Apple.</span> <span class="sc">Turk&rsquo;s Cap</span> (<i>Malvaviscus drummondii</i>) is also
called red mallow. The showy red flowers somewhat resemble a Turkish
fez. The broad petals remain closely wrapped around one another
at the base but spreading above; the stamen column is conspicuously
prolonged beyond the petals. The red apple-like fruits are nearly an
inch broad and half as high. They have a delicious flavor and may
be eaten raw or cooked. The fruits ripen in the late summer and fall,
a few weeks after the blooms appear. They begin to dry soon after
ripening and split into sections, scattering the seeds which are borne
in the center.</p>
<p>The plants are perennial, the leafy stems branching and spreading,
forming a clump which is commonly 2-3 feet high. Growing abundantly
in shade along streams in the central and southern parts of the
state and in moist woods in East Texas, it ranges from Florida to
Mexico. It is a desirable plant for cultivation and is hardier but not
as showy, as the large-flowered Turk&rsquo;s cap (<i>Malvaviscus grandiflora</i>),
a Mexican plant now widely cultivated for ornamental purposes in
South Texas.</p>

with smooth, erect, gray-green stems topped by the flower cluster.
The cup-shaped flowers are on slender stalks, the lower longer than
the upper. The upper leaves are divided into 1-3 linear divisions
and the lower into 5-7 divisions. The petals vary in color from
cherry-red to pink and white, often being quite fringed across the top.
The slightly yellow stamens are borne in a dense oblong column from
which the 10 red styles appear after the flower has been opened
several days.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wine Cup.</span> <span class="sc">Red Poppy-Mallow</span> (<i>Callirrho&euml; involucrata</i>) is the
common poppy-mallow throughout the state and ranges from Minnesota

branch. The five-pointed leaves are more or less divided or lobed,
sometimes with very linear divisions. Covering acres and acres of the
southern coastal prairie in March and April, and more or less common
on the drier prairies, this wine cup is a favorite flower. White and
pink forms of it exist, but the wine-red color is predominant.</p>

about 2 ft. high, with ovate or rounded leaves 1-2&frac12; in. long. It is
not extremely showy but makes an excellent low shrub for the garden
and will produce an abundance of blossoms from late spring until
fall. It is found in dry, rocky woods from Central Texas to Mexico.</p>
<p>Pavonia gets its name from the botanist, J. Pavon, who worked
particularly with South American plants. Several South American
species are in cultivation. The Texas pavonia is being introduced in

<p>About twenty different violets have been reported from the state,
mostly from the eastern part. The bird&rsquo;s-foot violet (<i>Viola pedata</i>)
comes into East Texas. It has large flowers, 1-1&frac34; in. across, the 3
lower petals much lighter than the dark purple upper ones. It resembles
the cultivated pansy, which, however, has been derived from <i>Viola

<p><span class="sc">Prairie-Lily.</span> <span class="sc">Showy Mentzelia</span> (<i>Mentzelia decapetala</i>) is a
handsome-flowered plant which ranges from the Panhandle to Southern
Canada. The large flowers, 3-5 inches across, greatly resemble those
of the cactus group and have the same tendency to open in the afternoon.
The stout, branching plant grows 2-2&frac12; feet high. The stems
are quite conspicuous, as they soon become white and shining; the
leaves are noticeable because they cling very closely to the clothing
by means of barbed hairs. This clinging characteristic is responsible
for the Mexican name of &ldquo;buena mujer&rdquo; (good woman), applied to
this and other similar species.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Stiff Nuttallia</span> (<i>Mentzelia stricta</i>) has smaller, paler flowers, but
otherwise it is very much like the showy mentzelia except for the
small leaves on the seed capsule. It grows in sandy soil, blooming in

in dry, rocky or sandy soil from Texas to Missouri, the flowers blooming
in May and June and the fruits ripening to a rose-red in the late
summer and fall. The flat-jointed stems are often oval but vary in
shape and in the number of large spines growing from the spine cushions
scattered over the stems. Sometimes no spines are present, but
often 1-2 occur along the margins. Numerous short leaves, which
are present only in the spring in this and other cacti, grow from the
spine cushions. The spine cushions also bear dense clusters of slender,
short brown spines. The flowers are yellow with red centers, 3-4 in.
broad, widely spreading. Like many other cacti, they open in bright
sunlight. The plant is low and has tuberous roots.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Texas Prickly Pear.</span> <span class="sc">Lindheimer&rsquo;s Cactus</span> (<i>Opuntia lindheimeri</i>)
has flowers which are yellow upon opening but which take on a lovely

the same joint. The large purple pear-shaped fruits are edible and
ripen in the summer and fall. The plants often grow in large clumps
and attain a great height. The spine cushions of the oval joints bear
2-3 rather short, stout, stiff spines. It is the common prickly pear
from Central Texas south into Mexico.</p>
<p>The pencil cactus or tasajillo (<i>Opuntia leptocaulis</i>), conspicuous for
its small stems and bright red fruits, is abundant in the state and Mexico.
&ldquo;Cholla,&rdquo; or walking-stick cactus (<i>Opuntia imbricata</i>), with long
slender stems and purple flowers, is common on western plains.</p>
<p>The cactus family has numerous representatives in Texas, but drastic
legislation is needed to save some of the natural beauty spots of the
western part of the state. The showy &ldquo;viznaga&rdquo; or barrel-cactus,
used in making cactus candy, is almost exterminated in the vicinity
of El Paso; and cactus fanciers are making great ravages on many
others. The fruits of many are edible; the young leaves of the prickly
pears are cooked for greens; and the stems are used for cattle feed

Greek meaning &ldquo;gore&rdquo; and refers to the red-purple color of some of the
flowers. The common name of loosestrife comes from an old legend
that they free from strife. The plant has slender stems 2-4 ft. high
and numerous flowers borne in loose spikes. The short, narrow leaves
are seldom more than 1-2 in. long. The delicate petals are somewhat
darker veined and do not last long. It blooms in the late spring and
summer.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Crape Myrtle</span> (<i>Lagerstroemia indica</i>), native of China or India,

Texas. The plants bloom in April and May. It is very much like
the rhombic evening-primrose (<i>&OElig;nothera rhombipetala</i>) but has slenderer,
shorter stems and is not often branched. The petals are similar,
and their rhombic shape easily distinguishes both of these plants from
other evening-primroses. The rhombic primrose grows 2-3 feet high
and is very abundant throughout the sandy area of North-central
Texas to Minnesota and Indiana.</p>
<p>There are many yellow evening-primroses very much alike in flower
which are usually called buttercups, a name first applied to the crowfoots.
The flowers usually have four showy petals which last only a
day, opening in the late afternoons and closing in the heat of the
following day. The seed capsules are usually long and narrow and are
borne below the petals. The fireweed is a well-known member of
this group. The water evening-primrose (<i>Jussi&aelig;a diffusa</i>) is abundant

<p><span class="sc">Pink Evening-Primrose.</span> <span class="sc">Pink Buttercup</span> (<i>Hartmannia tetraptera</i>)
blooms best in April, but a few scattered plants may continue to
bloom through the summer months. It is a perennial plant which does
well in cultivation. White, pink, blush, and other shades were introduced
by Childs in 1892 from seeds collected in Texas and were known
as the Mexican evening-primrose.</p>
<p>The earlier flowers are usually much larger than those which bloom
late in the season. The flowers are cup-shaped, 2-4 inches broad,
with 4 broad petals marked with deeper-colored veining and greenish-yellow
at the base. The sepals are united into a narrow tube above the
seed capsule and below the petals. This tube is about as long as the
capsule, sometimes a little shorter. The sepals do not overlap, are
slow about splitting, and are pushed to one side of the flower by the
opening petals. The seeds are borne in a club-shaped capsule which
is prominently ridged, the slender base being as long as the enlarged
seed-bearing portion.</p>
<p>The stems are usually trailing and branched at the base, sometimes
forming clumps two or more feet broad. The leaves are quite variable
in shape but are generally oblong and narrowed at the base,
with margins ranging from entire to deeply lobed and divided.</p>
<p>The group name honors Emanuel Hartmann of Louisiana; &ldquo;tetraptera&rdquo;
is from the Greek meaning &ldquo;four-winged&rdquo; and refers to the shape
of the seed-capsule. The plants in this group are sometimes placed
with the yellow evening-primroses of the &OElig;nothera group, but characteristics
other than color separate them.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Showy Primrose</span> (<i>Hartmannia speciosa</i>) is a large-flowered white
primrose found on plains and prairies from North Texas to Missouri.
The seed-capsules are narrowed at the base but are not stalked, and
the calyx tube is longer than the capsule.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rose Primrose</span> (<i>Hartmannia rosea</i>) is a small-flowered primrose
found in Southern and Southwestern Texas and Mexico. The flowers

in the afternoon and closing the next morning. The plants grow in
low clumps about a foot high. Numerous flowers are borne on the
stem along with the slender leaves. Four broad yellow petals make up
the cup-shaped portion of the flower above the slender calyx-tube,
which is 4-6 in. long. The seed-capsules at the base of the flower
develop four broad papery wings and reach at maturity a width of
3 in. These broad wings are responsible for the scientific name of the
plant. The capsules are easily blown about by the wind, and the
seeds are widely scattered.</p>
<p>The evening-primroses usually produce large, thready masses of
pollen. Every child is initiated into a buttercup fraternity at some
period in his life by being invited to smell of the flower and having his
nose smeared with the profuse pollen.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Square-Bud Primrose.</span> <span class="sc">Day Primrose.</span> <span class="sc">Creamcups</span> (<i>Meriolix
spinulosa</i>) has yellow cup-shaped flowers which last only twenty-four
hours but which are open during the day. It may readily be distinguished
from other evening-primroses by the slender woody stems
which soon become reddish or straw-colored. The stems grow 1-1&frac12;
ft. high with clusters of flowers at the top. The flowers are nearly
two inches broad and have four petals. The short, broad sepals are
winged on the back and make the buds appear square and pointed.</p>
<p>Another distinguishing feature is the disk-shaped stigma which is
sometimes yellow and sometimes black or dark brown. In the evening-primroses
previously mentioned, the stigma is divided into four narrow
lobes. The plants grow on gravelly hillsides from Arkansas to Mexico.
The slender capsules are over an inch long. Several other day primroses
are found in the state. They are all sometimes grouped with
the &oelig;notheras.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Large-Flowered</span> or <span class="sc">Lindheimer&rsquo;s Gaura</span> (<i>Gaura lindheimeri</i>) is,
like other members of this group, called kisses and wild honeysuckle
because of its sweet fragrance. Most of them produce an abundance of
nectar and make excellent honey plants. This is the handsomest
member of the group in Texas and is known in cultivation as a hardy
plant. It is native to the prairies of Southeast Texas and Louisiana
and blooms from March to May.</p>
<p>The four white petals have the group characteristic of turning fan-wise
toward the upper side of the flower, and the 8 long stamens and
the long style hang toward the lower part. Only a few flowers open at
one time around the spike, but numerous buds are densely crowded
above the open flowers. This plant has erect-ascending branches and
grows 2-5 feet high.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Prairie Gaura.</span> <span class="sc">Wild Honeysuckle</span> (<i>Gaura brachycarpa</i>) sometimes
grows 2-3 feet high, but is usually much lower. With favorable
rains, the flowering spikes grow quite long. This gaura may be recognized
by its stalkless 4-angled seed capsules. It blooms on Texas
prairies in April and May. Many other gauras are found in the state.</p>

<p class="caption">FLOWERING DOGWOOD</p>
</div>
<p class="bq">Leaves usually opposite; sepals usually 4, calyx tube joined to
the ovary; petals usually 4, or absent; stamens 4, alternate with
the petals; ovary inferior; fruit a drupe.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Flowering Dogwood</span> (<i>Cornus florida</i>) grows from Massachusetts to
Ontario, Texas, and Mexico, but few people realize that it grows very
luxuriantly and is widespread in the woods of East Texas. The beauty
of the dogwood is not in the flowers, as one might expect, but in the
four broad white floral leaves (bracts) which surround the flower-cluster.
These bracts are a creamy white but are often tinged with
pink. The minute greenish-white flowers have four petals and bloom
in March before the leaves appear. The oblong scarlet fruits, about
half an inch long, ripen in the fall.</p>
<p>It is said that dogwood gets its name from the fact that the bark
of an English dogwood was used to treat mangy dogs. Another source
for the name is given in a recent magazine which shows a photograph
of a section of wood from a dogwood tree. By means of the growth
rings of the tree, the section depicted the head of a swimming dog.
Among the useful substances obtained from the tree are quinine from
all parts, scarlet dye from the bark, and wood for tools. Enough
quinine is obtained by chewing the twigs to ward off malarial fever.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Rough-Leaved Cornel.</span> <span class="sc">Small-Flowered Dogwood</span> (<i>Cornus
asperifolia</i>) is hardly recognized as a dogwood because it does not have
showy floral bracts. The rough leaves become very lovely in the fall
as the veins take on a reddish-purple color. It is a very common shrub
in thickets along streams or in moist ground from Texas to Southern
Ontario. The flowers bloom in Texas from April to June, and the
white fruits mature in the fall. The fruits are about &frac14; inch in diameter
and contain 2 seeds with a stony coat which is covered by a thin
pulp.</p>
<p>The dogwood family includes several other trees and shrubs which
are common in Texas. Black gum (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i>) has 2-3 blue
oval fruits about half an inch long in a cluster. It is one of the first
trees in East Texas whose foliage takes on an autumnal coloring.
Lindheimer&rsquo;s garrya (<i>Garrya lindheimeri</i>), an evergreen shrub with
thick leathery leaves, is very abundant in the hills of Central and
West Texas. It bears dense clusters of small blue berries less than
&frac14; inch in diameter.</p>

is the pride of the North Texas prairie in late April and May. It is
also found in Oklahoma and Arkansas. In favorable seasons it grows
in great masses with the Indian blankets and the false coreopsis. The
umbrella-clusters of white flowers are very showy. The plants do
not have oil tubes, as do most members of the carrot family, and so
lack the strong scent common to many.</p>
<p>It usually grows about a foot high and is widely branched at the
top. The leaves are finely divided with numerous thread-like divisions.
The flowers are one-fourth inch broad and have five notched petals
which are broader than long. The fruits have two ball-shaped
divisions, each about one-eighth inch in diameter and faintly ridged.</p>

<p class="caption">FALSE PURPLE THISTLE. ERYNGO</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p><span class="sc">False Purple Thistle.</span> <span class="sc">Eryngo</span> (<i>Eryngium leavenworthii</i>) is not
a true thistle, but it is popularly known as one. The ancient Greeks
had the same idea, for the name &ldquo;Eryngium&rdquo; is their name for a kind
of thistle. Correctly speaking it is a purple carrot, as it belongs to a
large group of the carrot family, some of which are widely cultivated
abroad for their striking purple foliage. The flowers are clustered in
an oblong head, quite different from the dainty flower clusters of
Queen Anne&rsquo;s lace. Other common names of this group include
sea-holly, rattlesnake master, and button snake-root, the two latter
from their accredited property of curing snake-bites. Candelabrum
plant is a name sometimes given which is very appropriate because of
its branching habit of growth.</p>
<p>The plants grow one to three feet high, usually in dense masses
along roadsides and fields and on prairies from Central Texas to
Kansas. In August the gray-green foliage of the plants is quite conspicuous
against darker greens, but it gradually takes on a royal purple
hue. Few plants can rival it for beauty in late August and September.
The dense heads of purple flowers with their long, slender dark-blue
stamens add to the vividness. The dried plants are often kept for
winter decoration, but the purple does not remain so intense.</p>
<p>The stems are branched at the top, the flower heads growing on
short stalks in the forks of the branches. The deeply lobed leaves
clasp the stem, the leaf segments bearing many spiny-teeth. A tuft
of small, rigid, spiny leaves grows out of the top of the flower head.</p>
<p>Several eryngoes are found in the state. The yucca-leaved eryngo
(<i>Eryngium aquaticum</i>) grows in the summer in sandy areas or low
grounds from Texas to Minnesota and Connecticut. It bears little
resemblance in habit of growth or coloring to the purple thistle. Most
of the long leaves are clustered at the base, and a stout flower stalk
bears at the top several head-like clusters of white flowers.</p>
<p>The carrot family is a large group of plants, most of which have
lacy, fern-like leaves and dainty umbrella-clusters of small flowers and
fruit which separates into two ribbed 1-seeded divisions. The plants
are usually rich in oil tubes, and some contain deadly poisons.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Beggar&rsquo;s Ticks.</span> <span class="sc">Seed-Ticks.</span> <span class="sc">Bird&rsquo;s Nest Carrot</span> (<i>Daucus
pusillus</i>) is probably more familiar in fruit than in flower. The
clusters of seeds resemble a bird&rsquo;s nest. The fact that the seeds are
covered with several rows of barbed prickles makes them very difficult
to remove from clothing. Their presence in wool renders it inferior
in quality. It is very abundant throughout the state from April to
June and occurs in most of the Southern and Western States.</p>
<p>The small white flowers grow in a dense, lace-like cluster at the top
of slender stems 1-2 ft. high. The leaves are finely divided. The
flower cluster is long-stalked and is surrounded by a circle of the green
leaves; thus the flowers as well as the seeds have a nest-like appearance.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wild Carrot.</span> <span class="sc">Queen Anne&rsquo;s Lace</span> (<i>Daucus carota</i>), the ancestor
of the garden carrot, was introduced from Europe and may be found
in scattered places over the state. It is a larger plant than the beggar&rsquo;s
ticks, with very wide-spreading and dainty flower clusters. It does not
bloom until summer.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Wild Dill.</span> <span class="sc">Prairie Parsley</span> (<i>Pleiotaenia nuttallii</i>) is a conspicuous
plant on prairies throughout the state and ranges to Michigan and
Alabama. The flowers bloom in April and May, and the seeds mature
and fall in June and July. The stiff, stout stems, commonly two feet
high, become dry and brown but remain standing through the winter
months. The upper leaves are not divided so much as the lower, which
are deeply divided and have broad segments. The flowers are small
and greenish-yellow and grow in clusters about 2 inches broad.</p>
<p>The foliage and seeds were used for seasoning by pioneers. It is
very much like the cultivated dill (<i>Anethum graveolens</i>), a native
of Southeastern Europe. The latter is taller and has leaves with
threadlike divisions.</p>
<p>Other well-known members of the carrot family include the parsnip,
parsley, myrrh, chervil, caraway, and celery. The well-known poison
hemlock (<i>Conium maculatum</i>), by which Socrates met his death, is
a native of Europe but may now be found in North and South America.
It grows in great abundance along the streams of the Edwards
Plateau between Fredricksburg and Austin.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Tree-Huckleberry.</span> <span class="sc">Farkleberry</span> (<i>Batodendron arboreum</i>) is
also known as upland-huckleberry, sparkleberry, and gooseberry. The
name is Greek and means &ldquo;blackberry tree.&rdquo; The huckleberries are
often placed in a family separate from other heaths. The tree-huckleberry
is a shrub or small tree, very abundant in the woods of
East Texas and the Southern States. The dainty, drooping sprays of
white bell-shaped flowers remind one of the lily-of-the-valley. The
shining oval leaves are short-stalked, 1-2 in. long. The black berries
are not edible.</p>
<p>Well-known members of the heath family include the trailing arbutus,
cranberry, blueberry, bean-berry, winter-green, rhododendron,
and azalea. Thickets of the pink azalea or swamp-honeysuckle
(<i>Azalea nudiflora</i>) occur in a few places in East Texas. In the mountains
of Southwest Texas may be found the arbutus-tree, madro&ntilde;a,
or naked Indian, so called because of its red wood and scaling bark.
Its small, red fleshy fruits look like strawberries. Stagger-bush
(<i>Neopieris mariana</i>) is a common shrub in swampy places.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Texas Water-Pimpernel.</span> <span class="sc">Brookweed</span> (<i>Samolus cuneatus</i>) is a
plant found wherever springs or moist ledges occur in limestone hills
of Texas. The plants have a basal rosette of broad rounded leaves.
The slender stems are 6-12 inches high and bear a few leaves which
are narrowed at the base. The 5-lobed white flowers are short and
bell-shaped and appear from April to September. The pink water-pimpernel
(<i>Samolus ebracteatus</i>) grows in sandy soil along the coast.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Shooting Star</span> (<i>Dodecatheon stanfieldia</i>) is a rare plant and should
be afforded protection. It is found in rich, moist soil from Central
Texas to Louisiana. The flowers are very much like those of
<i>Dodecatheon meadia</i> but are larger and have broader petals.</p>
<p>The primrose family is represented in horticulture by many primroses
from Asia, cyclamens from Greece to Syria, and the cowslip
from Europe. The scarlet pimpernel (<i>Anagallis arvensis</i>) is found on
sandy prairies in South Texas in the spring.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mexican Persimmon</span> (<i>Diospyros texana</i>) is also called &rsquo;possum
plum, &ldquo;chapote,&rdquo; and black persimmon. It is a shrub or small tree
found in river-valleys and on limestone hills from Central Texas to
Mexico. It may be easily recognized by its smooth, light-gray bark,
small leaves, and creamy heath-like flowers. The bell-shaped flowers
are in dense clusters on the tree which has pollen-bearing flowers,
whereas the seed-bearing flowers, which grow on a separate tree, are
larger and fewer in number. The black fruits ripen in August, when
the pulp becomes juicy but somewhat insipid.</p>
<p>The black wood is hard and, like other species of ebony, takes an
excellent polish. It is used for making tools. The Mexicans use a
black dye obtained from the fruits in dyeing sheep-skins. The common
persimmon (<i>Diospyros virginiana</i>) is found wild from Connecticut
to East Texas, where the sprouts are vicious pests in plowed lands.</p>

on gravelly limestone hills in Texas and Arkansas. The stems are
branched near the base and often form hemispherical clumps a foot
in diameter which are covered with pink flowers in June. The plants
are being rapidly exterminated for ornamental purposes, for they are
very showy and the flowers will last two weeks or more. The flowers
have a united tubular corolla with 5 lobes.</p>
<p>The scientific name is from the Greek meaning &ldquo;red.&rdquo; The flowers
of some species are red, but those in Texas are pink. The Texan
centaury (<i>Erythraea texense</i>) is a very small plant with small flowers.
It is found from Texas to Missouri in June and July. Buckley&rsquo;s centaury
or pink gentian (<i>Erythraea calycosa</i>) is found in moist soil in
the western part of the state. It is a tall, slender plant 1-2 ft. high.
It ranges from Missouri to Mexico. The centaury plants were formerly
valued as a medicine for fever. They were gathered and dried
at flowering time.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Purple Gentian.</span> <span class="sc">Bluebell</span> (<i>Eustoma russellianum</i>) is also called
Russell&rsquo;s eustoma, Texas bluebell, blue gentian, blue marsh lily, and
bosque blue gentian. The latter name is used in El Paso, where the
purple gentian grows on the flood plain of the Rio Grande River. It
is one of the loveliest flowers in the state, sometimes occurring in
great profusion on moist prairies from Mexico to Colorado and Louisiana.
It is especially abundant in Southeast Texas, where it is gathered
in wholesale quantities by florists. It is an excellent cut-plant,
the flowers lasting for several days and new buds continually opening.</p>
<p>Few people have had success in transplanting the purple gentian
into their gardens. Only recently has there been a report of seeds
successfully germinated. It is said that soaking for 48 hours in water
will produce germination. Each flower produces a number of very
minute seeds.</p>
<p>The large, bell-shaped flowers, 2-3 inches broad, are a bluish-purple;
in fading, they spread widely and take on more of the blue tinge.
They are constricted into a short narrow tube at the base. Inside,
the flowers are marked with yellow at the base and have purple
markings in the throat. The five stamens with large anthers are
attached to the corolla tube. At the time the pollen is shed, the
anthers lie in a horizontal position around the style. The stigmas
are interesting. There are two diamond-shaped lobes which are erect
until they are ready to receive pollen, and then they take a horizontal
position. The calyx has five linear lobes which are united at the base
with a colorless membrane. The oblong capsules are about half an
inch long.</p>
<p>The plants are very smooth and are erect, with a few erect branches.
The leaves are ovate-oblong and are usually 1-2&frac12; inches long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eustoma&rdquo; means &ldquo;open mouth&rdquo;, referring to the large throat of
the flower. The smaller bluebell in Southern Texas and Northern
Mexico is <i>Eustoma gracile</i>.</p>

June. It is particularly abundant on southern coastal prairies where
it makes a showy landscape display with phlox, coreopsis, and other
plants in March and April. The sabbatias are named in honor of two
Italian botanists, L. and C. Sabbati.</p>
<p>The plants are low, 3-12 inches high, and have wing-angled stems
and short smooth leaves about &frac12;-1&frac14; inches long. The flowers are
about 1&frac12; inches broad, much larger than those of the mountain pink,
and more cup-shaped. They are usually deep pink in color, but
purplish-pink and white forms may occasionally be noted. Around
the throat are yellow, star-shaped markings over the white base of

are covered with narrow linear leaves. Like that of other amsonias,
the tubular throat is lined with white hairs. The name of twin-pods
might be given to the amsonias. The numerous seeds are borne in
two narrow, erect pods which are united at the base and split along
the inner sides. The pods are 3-4 inches long. The plant is perennial,
growing in low clumps on limestone hillsides of Texas. The
plants in North Texas form a conspicuous bluish-green line on low hills,
when the flowers bloom in late March and April.</p>
<p>The oleander, periwinkle, and vinca are well-known members of
the dogbane family. They all have a milky sap which is quite

<p><span class="sc">Green-Flowered Milkweed.</span> <span class="sc">Silkweed</span> (<i>Asclepiodora decumbens</i>)
is a widespread plant from Arkansas to Utah and Northern Mexico.
It is found on the central and western plains, blooming in early spring
and sometimes again in the fall. The stout, leafy stems, topped by
the ball-shaped heads of flowers form conspicuous clumps about a
foot high. The flowers have a sweet nectar which draws many insect
visitors. They bloom in April and early May, and the large
warty pods mature in a few weeks. As the seeds bear a tuft of hairs
at one end, they are easily scattered by the wind and other agents.
It is one of the first plants to appear on burned-over areas.</p>
<p>The milkweeds get their name from the bitter milky sap. The
flowers are quite different from other flowers in that there is a crown
between the petals and the stamens. In many the pollen is borne
in two pear-shaped masses with a thread-like connection. In the
green-flowered milkweed, purple hoods are attached to the crown and
hang over the pollen-sacs.</p>

In Texas it is found in the sandy areas of the eastern and central
parts. It blooms in the late spring and summer. Other common
names include orange milkweed, orange-root, Indian posy, and orange
swallow-wort. The leaves are poisonous to stock, but the honey is
not considered poisonous. The monarch butterfly is a voracious feeder
on the plant. It was at one time valued for its medicinal properties,
but is now little used. Several plants are known by the common name
of &ldquo;swallow-wort&rdquo; and are so called because they bloom in the spring
when the swallows appear.</p>
<p>The leafy stems often grow one to two feet high. At the top of the
stem are several clusters of small orange-colored flowers. The petals
hang down when the pollen is ready to be shed. There is a crown
of five erect, orange-colored hoods around the flat stigma.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pretty Dodder.</span> <span class="sc">Love Vine.</span> <span class="sc">Strangle-Weed</span> (<i>Cuscuta indecora</i>)
may be noted in conspicuous orange or gold masses covering other
plants. It is a leafless parasitic vine bearing small clusters of white
flowers. The flowers are less than one fourth inch broad and have
the petal-tips turned inward. There are many dodders in the state,
and each kind is parasitic only on certain plants. The pretty dodder
attacks the wild verbena and other herbs and low shrubs from Illinois
to Texas and other parts of America.</p>

<p class="bq">Plants twining or erect; sepals 5; corolla mostly funnelform,
5-lobed; stamens 5, on corolla tube; ovary superior; fruit usually
a ball-shaped capsule separating into 2-4 lobes.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Texas Bindweed</span> (<i>Convolvulus hermannioides</i>) has small white
morning-glory flowers with a dark-red center. They are seldom more
than an inch broad. The spreading or twining vines reach a length
of several feet. The leaves are very variable in shape and often have
spreading lobes at each side of the base like the hoary bindweed (<i>Convolvulus
incanus</i>). Both grow on Texas plains, but the hoary bindweed
is widely distributed from Kansas and Arkansas to Mexico.
The Texas bindweed may be distinguished by the ear-like projections
at the base of the sepals. The flowers bloom from April to August.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Purple Morning-Glory.</span> <span class="sc">Bindweed.</span> <span class="sc">Tie-Vine</span> (<i>Ipomoea trifida</i>)
is a lovely but pernicious vine of Texas, Mexico, and tropical America.
The roots are perennial and very difficult to eradicate from cotton and
corn fields. It blooms from spring to fall, the flowers opening only
in the morning. The morning-glory group is very large, and many
showy forms are found in Texas. The sweet potato (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i>)
and others are valued for their tuberous roots.</p>

<h3>PHLOX FAMILY (Polemoniaceae)</h3>
<p class="bq">Mostly annual and perennial herbs; calyx 5-lobed; corolla
tubular, 5-lobed; ovary usually 3-celled; style often 3-parted;
stamens 5, inserted on corolla-tube; capsules small.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Standing Cypress.</span> <span class="sc">Red Gilia</span> (<i>Gilia rubra</i>) might also be called
torch flowers, for the tall spikes with their masses of red tubular
flowers make flaming spots of color on the edges of the post oak
woods in May and June. It is sometimes known as Indian plume,
Texas plume, or red Texas star.</p>
<p>The plants are usually unbranched and grow two to three feet high;
however, if the top of the stem is removed or injured near the time of
flowering, it will branch into several flowering spikes. The stems are
pale green and quite leafy with the finely dissected leaves. The
narrow tubular flowers are over an inch long and have broad spreading
lobes which, on their inner surface, are a pale orange-red dotted with
a darker red. The flowers, which resemble those of the cypress vine,
are closely clustered on the stem, those at the top opening first. The
capsules are nearly an inch long and contain numerous papery seeds.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Blue Gilia.</span> <span class="sc">Golden Eye</span> (<i>Gilia rigidula</i>), differing markedly from
the red gilia in the shape of the flowers, has a short, broadly flaring
corolla with a conspicuous yellow center. The flowers are nearly an
inch broad. The plants are perennial and are often widely branched
at the base, forming clumps nearly a foot broad. The blue gilia is
found on hills and stony plains from Central Texas to Mexico and
New Mexico and blooms from March to October.</p>
<p><span class="sc">White Gilia.</span> <span class="sc">Long-Flowered Gilia</span> (<i>Gilia longiflora</i>) has slender,
erect stems, 1-2 feet high, terminated by a flat-topped cluster of tubular
white flowers. The flowers have a narrow tube, about 1&frac12;
inches long, and 5 broad, spreading lobes. The leaves have threadlike
divisions. The plants are very showy when they are in bloom
and are especially abundant in sandy regions of Northwest Texas in
the late summer and fall.</p>
<p>Few flower groups show such a decided red, white, and blue as
the gilias. The group is a large one, mostly of Western North America,
and is named in honor of the Spanish botanist, Philipp Salvador Gil.
Some of the gilias are known in cultivation and are considered hardy
plants of easy culture. The standing cypress may be grown from
seeds planted in August or September, or plants may be transplanted
in the spring.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Drummond&rsquo;s Phlox</span> (<i>Phlox drummondii</i>) has rightly been called
&ldquo;Texan pride.&rdquo; A drive late in April through the post oak sandy
region east of Austin to the Brazos River and southeast to Victoria
will disclose it in all its glory. The seeds were collected by Thomas
Drummond in 1834 and sent to W. J. Hooker in the spring of 1835.
Hooker, an eminent botanist, described it from the plants grown from
those seeds in the Kew Gardens in London. According to his description,
the plants were mostly of a brilliant rose-red with more or
less purple in the flowers of some plants and darker red eyes in
nearly all. It is quite probable that Drummond collected his seeds
in the vicinity of Gonzales, the western limit of his Texas trip, where
today wild phloxes which match his description occur in great profusion.
The seeds collected may have included some from hybrid plants,
as red phloxes with a white eye are found on the eastern edge of the
red-phlox area, and the dark-eyed purple and red are found on its
western limits in close proximity to the &ldquo;phlox purple&rdquo; variety.</p>
<p>The plant has long been a horticultural favorite, and more than
200 varieties have been described, few of which excel the native varieties
in size or coloring.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Purple Phlox</span> (<i>Phlox drummondii</i>-purple varieties) grows in sandy
soil in Central Texas. The variety with the white throat and red-star
eye is common in the southeastern part of the state. It is especially
abundant in Wilson and Karnes Counties, where extensive masses of
purple may be noted in open sandy places among mesquite and post
oak trees. This is a very vigorous phlox and produces large stems and
flowers. Studies are being made to determine whether these purple
phloxes are varieties of Drummond&rsquo;s phlox or should be called by
other names.</p>
<p>The variety with the purple throat and the two white marks at the
base of each corolla lobe grows northwest of the range of the red-flowered
Drummond&rsquo;s phlox. It blooms from April to June and seems
to withstand cold better than any of the annual phloxes except the
dwarf phlox.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Berlandier&rsquo;s Phlox</span> (<i>Phlox glabriflora</i>) differs from Drummond&rsquo;s
phlox in many particulars. The flowers are usually a bluish-lavender
which at a distance suggests the wild verbena. Like the other phloxes
on this page, it has both stem and leaves clothed with scattered, long,
soft hairs. The large corolla is marked with white at the base of
the lobes and has a short, smooth tube. The vigorous plants branch
profusely and often form masses two and three feet broad. This
phlox may be found on sandy prairies south of Kingsville and west
of Hebbronville in the winter and spring months but is at its best
in February and March. It was first collected by Louis Berlandier at
several places along the southern coast in 1828 and 1829.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Heller&rsquo;s Phlox</span> (<i>Phlox helleri</i>) is a close relative of Berlandier&rsquo;s
phlox but has a hairy corolla-tube, smaller flowers, and shorter leaves.
It is found from March to May in sand near the coast around Copano,
Aransas, and Nueces bays.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Slender Phlox</span> (<i>Phlox tharpii</i>) has a long, hairy corolla-tube, and
the slender stems are usually unbranched. Only four flowers are
borne in a cluster. It is very abundant in Frio and Dimmit Counties
in April. Theodore Roosevelt, in describing a peccary hunt south
of Uvalde in April, 1904, mentions these fields of purple.</p>

phlox marked with yellow around the eye or throat. Its large capsule,
containing 12 or 15 seeds, is another conspicuous feature and shows
its relationship with the perennial phloxes of West Texas. It forms a
lovely display with bluebonnets and low prairie spider-worts in the

leaves which are pointed and widely spreading. The flat-topped
clusters of pale pink, blue, white, or purple flowers bloom in March

with soft hairs.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Large-Flowered Prairie Phlox</span> (<i>Phlox villosissima</i>) grows in a

found on other rivers in Southwest Texas. It has long, woody roots
reaching toward the necessary moisture. The flowers are very large,
and only a few are open at a time. It differs from the prairie phlox
in its shorter and more numerous leaves, its larger flowers with their
broader lobes, and alternate branches in the flower cluster. The
prairie phloxes are perennial and are easily grown in Southwest

base. The leaves are divided into 5-9 broad segments which are
irregularly toothed. It is not known in cultivation, but a similar
plant from California is used to cover beds in which bulbs are planted.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Purple Phacelia</span> (<i>Phacelia patuliflora</i>) is a low, spreading annual
growing on sandy prairies in the southern part of the state. &ldquo;Patuliflora&rdquo;
means &ldquo;spreading flower&rdquo; and refers to the royal purple corollas
which are widely spreading and nearly an inch broad. It is the handsomest
phacelia among the fifteen or more species found in the state.
It blooms from February to May.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Blue nama</span> (<i>Nama ovatum</i>) is a water-leaf growing in ponds and

curled flower clusters and lavender-blue flowers very much like those
of some of the heliotropes and borages. A California borage is also
called fiddle-neck. The flowers are tubular at the base with 5 broadly
spreading lobes. The 5 spreading stamens extending from the flowers
are responsible for the name of &ldquo;spider-flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The erect, unbranched stems may be seen on gravelly limestone
slopes or in open woods from Central to Southwestern Texas. The
large, thin leaves are finely divided and clothed with soft hairs. In
woods the plants may grow 1&frac12;-2 ft. high, but on rocky slopes they
are seldom more than a foot high. The flowers bloom in April and
May, a long blooming season resulting from the numerous flowers
which open as the curling stems unfold. It is an annual plant which
does well in cultivation and makes a lovely addition to the flower
garden.</p>
<p>Nearly a hundred phacelias are found in Western North America.
The name is from the Greek meaning &ldquo;cluster.&rdquo; Most of them are

slender vervain. It is a perennial which takes on renewed blooming
activity from early spring until fall, but usually only scattered plants
bloom after June. It is very abundant in this state and other Southern
States.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and scattered along the slender branches at
the top of the stem. The upper leaves are narrow, those of the mid-stem
divided; and the lower are broad and irregularly toothed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Large-Flowered Vervain</span> (<i>Verbena plicata</i>) shows some variation

called sweet William, a name which properly belongs to the blue
woodland phlox (<i>Phlox divaricata</i>) or to the clove pink. There is only
a faint fragrance to the wild verbena.</p>
<p>Along highways and in the fields the wild verbena blooms in great
profusion from spring until the plants are killed by a severe freeze.
The flower stalks often grow quite long and are topped by a flat
cluster of flowers around the new buds. The old calyx tubes surrounding
the small nutlets remain on the stalk for many weeks.
Children delight in pulling off the purple tubular corollas so that they
can suck the abundant nectar from the tube and then string them
together for a necklace, which they make by inserting the base of
one tube into the throat of the adjoining corolla.</p>
<p>The wild verbena is a perennial plant with many prostrate branches.
The leaves are thick, rough, and divided into narrow segments. It is
one of the most familiar plants of the South Plains region, ranging
from Missouri and Arizona to Northern Mexico. It is seldom used in
gardens, but it is one of the plants used by the highway department
for roadside planting. Where it has been used in gardens for low
border mass effects, it has been a delight throughout the warm months
with its showy, profuse blooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verbena&rdquo; is the Latin name for a sacred plant. There are nearly
one hundred species of verbenas, one of which is European and the
others American. About twenty-five of these are found in Texas,
part of them belonging to the vervain group. The plains verbena
and the slender vervain are the ones most widely distributed. Among
other very lovely verbenas found in the state are Wright&rsquo;s verbena in
West Texas and Lambert&rsquo;s verbena in East Texas. A South American
verbena (<i>Verbena venosa</i>), with brilliant purple flowers, has escaped
cultivation in Southeast Texas.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wright&rsquo;s Verbena</span> (<i>Verbena wrightii</i>) is quite similar to the plains
verbena but has larger flowers of a reddish-purple color. The plants

<p><span class="sc">French Mulberry</span> (<i>Callicarpa americana</i>) is a low shrub 3-6 ft.
high, also known as the Bermuda mulberry or sour-bush. It is easily
recognized in the fall by the clusters of reddish-purple berries and
large ovate leaves 3-6 in. long. The showy berries are responsible for
the scientific name which means &ldquo;beautiful fruit.&rdquo; It grows in woods
of sandy areas from Central Texas to Florida and Virginia, and also
in the West Indies. The variety with white fruit is not so common
as the purple-fruited variety. The flowers are inconspicuous, pale
pink or white. The shrub is well-known in cultivation but is not so
hardy as the Japanese callicarpa.</p>
<p>The verbena family includes many tropical and sub-tropical shrubs,
some of which are widely cultivated in Texas. Lantana (<i>Lantana
camara</i>) has orange and yellow flowers and is a profuse summer
bloomer. The common lilac lantana in cultivation was introduced
from Brazil, but there are two native lilac lantanas in Southern Texas.
Lavender, or vitex, introduced from Europe, is an excellent shrub for
summer bloom.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Prairie Skullcap</span> (<i>Scutellaria resinosa</i>) turns its saucy flowers upward
and covers the dense clumps with a purple glow. The tubular
flowers are nearly an inch long and 2-lipped, with two short lobes
forming the velvety, arched upper lip and with three broad lobes
forming the spreading lower lip. The middle lobe is marked by a conspicuous
white spot dotted with purple. Numerous stems grow from a
woody, perennial root on rocky prairies and limestone slopes from
Texas to Arizona and Nebraska.</p>
<p>The many skullcaps in the state are easily distinguished from other
mints by the crest on the upper surface of the calyx. Most of them
have small oval or rounded leaves, and all have purple flowers. They
get their scientific name from the Latin word meaning &ldquo;dish,&rdquo; referring
to the shape of the calyx.</p>
<p>The mint family is a large one, well represented in Texas. The European
horehound (<i>Marrubium vulgare</i>) has become a pernicious weed

physostegias are rapidly growing in favor as garden flowers, as different
species will produce blooms throughout the season, if the flowering
spikes are cut and not allowed to seed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Brazos Mint</span> (<i>Brazoria scutellarioides</i>) is a lovely little annual
found on the plains of Central Texas. The plants are usually less

flowers make it quite conspicuous during favorable seasons. Although
the name indicates a resemblance to the skullcap, it might be mistaken
for a dwarf physostegia. The corollas have much the same
delicate lavender coloring, but the flaring calyx more closely resembles
that of the Texas salvia. It is also called twin-flower, wild lilac, and
honey plant.</p>
<p><i>Brazoria truncata</i>, with larger and paler flowers, is very abundant

<p><span class="sc">Henbit.</span> <span class="sc">Dead Nettle</span> (<i>Lamium amplexicaule</i>) is a troublesome
weed on lawns everywhere in the state and in most of the United
States. It is a winter annual introduced from Europe and Asia. The
flowers often begin to bloom in December and continue until March
or April. The stems branch from the base, and the flowers grow in
stalkless clusters with the upper leaves.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Prairie Pennyroyal.</span> <span class="sc">Lemon Mint.</span> <span class="sc">Mexican Tea</span> (<i>Hedeoma
drummondii</i>) is a low perennial plant characterized by the lemon-like
odor of the foliage, the narrow, tubular lavender corollas, and the
bulging finely-ribbed tubular calyx. The flowers and leaves are about
half an inch long. The low, bushy clumps grow on rocky plains and
hillsides throughout Texas, the flowers blooming during the late spring
and summer. A tea made from the foliage, either fresh or dried,
is considered of value for its soothing effect. A few leaves in iced
tea add a piquant flavor. The name is from the Greek and means
&ldquo;sweet smell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American pennyroyal is <i>Hedeoma pulegioides</i>. The leaves and
flowering tops are collected in July and August and dried. It yields
an oil used in medicine.</p>

<p class="caption">PALE WILD BERGAMOT</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Pale Wild Bergamot</span> (<i>Monarda fistulosa mollis</i>) is a very lovely
member of the horsemint group. The slender stems are branched
at the top, each branch having a terminal cluster of lavender flowers.
The flowers are tubular and two-lipped, 1-1&frac12; in. long, the upper
lip narrow and the lower broad and three lobed. The upper lip is
clothed with soft hairs.</p>
<p>The wild bergamot grows in the states east of the Rocky Mountains,
and several varieties are known. In Texas it grows in moist woods
in the eastern part and along streams in North Texas. It is a perennial
which is sometimes cultivated. The stems are usually about two
feet high. The leaves are short-stalked and lance-shaped, the margins
having a few short teeth. The leaves have a pleasant aroma and are
used in flavoring tea. Medicinally they are used as a stimulant and
as a remedy for colic pains.</p>
<p>The brilliant, scarlet-flowered Oswego tea (<i>Monarda didyma</i>) of the
Eastern States is not native to Texas. It is used as a substitute
for tea.</p>

<p class="caption">GREEN HORSEMINT</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Green</span> or <span class="sc">White Horsemint</span> (<i>Monarda punctata</i>) differs from the
wild bergamot in having numerous clusters of flowers at the top of
the stem. These clusters are surrounded by many short, drooping
floral leaves which are blotched with white or occasionally have a
purplish tinge. The yellow corollas are dotted with purple and are
about an inch long. The calyx tube is ribbed, and the lobes are
short and triangular. In growth habit and shape of leaves it is very
much like the purple horsemint, but in flower it is readily distinguished
by the yellow flowers and green and white floral leaves. The plants
are perennial, much-branched, and somewhat downy. They are found
in the Eastern and Central States and bloom in Texas from late May
to July.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dwarf Horsemint</span> (<i>Monarda clinopodioides</i>) is another horsemint
of sandy plains in Texas and Oklahoma. The plants are usually less
than a foot high. They have white corollas, and the short bracts are
purplish-brown with hairy margins. This horsemint is not so widespread
as the green and purple horsemint.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Purple Horsemint.</span> <span class="sc">Lemon Monarda</span> (<i>Monarda citriodora</i>) is
lovely not only because of its dainty flowers but especially because
of the floral leaves or bracts surrounding the flowers. These bracts
take on a reddish-purple color and may be marked with white and
green. The purple varies from rosy tints to a royal hue.</p>
<p>The flowers grow in whorls or rosettes at the top of the stem, new
ones appearing with continued growth until there may be ten or
more clusters on a stem. The corollas are narrow, tubular, and two-lipped,
varying in color from lavender to white and commonly marked
with small purple dots. The tubular calyx has five very narrow lobes,
which are hairy and as long as the tube; the throat of the calyx is
closed by a dense ring of white hairs.</p>
<p>Growing in erect clumps one to two feet high, the plants form conspicuous
patches along highways and cover many pastures. The
leaves are short-stalked and narrowed at both ends, the margins being
sharply toothed. The purple floral leaves are oblong, with the midrib
prolonged into a slender bristle or awn. These numerous bracts curve
downward and overlap, the lower ones being longer.</p>
<p>The purple horsemint is common on plains from Mexico to Missouri
and Kansas and ranges eastward to Florida. It blooms from May
to August but is most profuse in June.</p>
<p>The monardas are North American plants named in honor of Nicolas
Monardes, a Spanish physician and botanist. Some are valued for
their perfume oils, and some have a slight medicinal value. The
purple horsemint is rich in nectar, but the honey produced is not
of the first quality. The dried plants are used in hens&rsquo; nests to drive
off mites and fleas.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Plains Lemon Monarda</span> (<i>Monarda pectinata</i>) is the common horsemint
on the dry western plains in the state and ranges to Arizona and
Nebraska. The flowers are pink or white but are not spotted with
purple. The floral leaves are lance-shaped.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Prairie Sage</span> (<i>Salvia pitcheri</i>) grows in scattered clumps throughout
the central prairie region from Texas to Illinois and Minnesota.
Because of its sky-blue, tubular, 2-lipped flowers, it is one of the
plants most easily identified. The gray-green leaves have the characteristic
sage odor and can be used for sage tea. The plants are
two to three feet high and bloom from late spring to November.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Red Sage</span> or <span class="sc">Salvia</span>. <span class="sc">Indian Fire</span> (<i>Salvia coccinea</i>) is a hardy
plant in cultivation and blooms nearly all the year. It is native to
the Gulf States, in Texas growing in woods near the coast. The red
flowers are nearly an inch long.</p>
<p>There are nearly five hundred salvias known. Three European
species are cultivated for their leaves, and many others are grown
for ornamental purposes. The common bedding salvia is <i>Salvia
splendens</i>, native of Brazil. The handsomest flower in the state is the
red-flowered <i>Salvia regla</i>, found in a few mountain canyons in West

after every rain from April to November. The corollas are usually
purple but vary to blue and white. They have a narrow upper lip

<p><span class="sc">Purple Nightshade</span> (<i>Solanum elaeagnifolium</i>) is sometimes called
silver-leaved nightshade or &ldquo;trompillo.&rdquo; Although bearing lovely star-shaped
lavender flowers, the purple nightshade is considered a pernicious
weed in fields and gardens. It grows from deep, woody perennial
roots and blooms profusely even in seasons of drouth from May
to October. It is found on plains from Missouri to Texas and
Arizona. The branched plants grow 1-3 ft. high and are more or less
covered with prickles. The yellow fruits resemble small tomatoes and
remain on the old stalks for months. They are said to be poisonous.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Torrey&rsquo;s Nightshade</span> (<i>Solanum torreyi</i>) is a plant similar to the
purple nightshade, but it has broader, irregularly-toothed leaves and
larger flowers and seldom grows as high.</p>
<p>The solanum group comprises nearly a thousand species and includes
many well-known plants, among which are the Irish potato and
the egg-plant. Bitter-sweet and Jerusalem cherry are cultivated for
their showy fruits. Several members of the group are said to be very

<p><span class="sc">Buffalo-Bur.</span> <span class="sc">Yellow Nightshade</span> (<i>Solanum rostratum</i>) is a
common weed in waste places and on prairies from Tennessee to
Mexico, but the spreading plants are often covered with their yellow
star blossoms. Children call them sticker-weeds because of the vicious
prickles on the foliage. They are also called tread-softly, Texas nettle,
prickly potato, and bumble-bee bush, the latter name being given
because of the numerous bee visitors. The name of buffalo-bur dates
back to the days when buffaloes roamed the plains, the prickly fruits
clinging to the shaggy coats of the huge beasts.</p>
<p>The yellow flowers which bloom from May to October resemble
those of the purple nightshade in shape and size. The stamens of the
nightshades shed their pollen through small openings at the top of the
pollen-sac. The buffalo-bur has one stamen very much larger than
the other four. The leaves are once or twice divided into broad
rounded segments. The berries are enclosed in the enlarged and spiny
calyx.</p>

the state and ranges to Arkansas, Mexico, and California. The
flowers and fruits are usually hidden beneath the leaves. The fruit,
a berry very much like a small tomato, is enclosed in the enlarged
sac-like calyx. The scientific name is from the Greek word meaning
&ldquo;bladder&rdquo; and refers to the inflated calyx. Some ground cherries
are cultivated for their fruits which are edible and are used for making
preserves and pies.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Purple Ground Cherry</span> (<i>Physalis lobata</i>) flaunts its gay purple

The low bushes seldom grow more than three or four feet high. It is
a startling and lovely sight to see a hillside which was a mass of gray
transformed overnight into a delicate hue of lavender. This happens
shortly after heavy rains, and for this reason the plant is sometimes
called barometer bush. Leucophyllum has been widely introduced as a
shrub in Texas gardens, where the ashy-gray leaves are quite effective
against dark green shrubbery. The name is Greek and means &ldquo;white

<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p><span class="sc">Scarlet Paint-Brush</span> (<i>Castilleja indivisa</i>) is also called Indian
paint-brush, painted-cup, entire-leaved paint brush, and Indian pink.
One of the most inspiring landscape displays of native flowers is
formed by the scarlet paint-brush. It is found in sandy soil from the
northeastern to southwestern parts of the state and blooms from March
to May but is at its best in April. The paint-brush display of red is
equalled or excelled only by that of two other wild-flower favorites&mdash;the
red Drummond&rsquo;s phlox in south-central sandy regions and the
beautiful gaillardia of black land prairies.</p>
<p>The intense scarlet-red is due to the coloring of the broadened
floral leaves (bracts) at the tip of the stem. These bracts almost hide
the inconspicuous cream-colored flowers which are about an inch long.
The bracts are oblong, the tips being broader than the base and deeply
stained with scarlet.</p>
<p>The scarlet paint-brush is an annual plant, commonly six to twelve
inches high, and is sometimes branched at the base. The leaves are
rough-nerved and wavy-margined. Occasionally the leaves have two
linear basal lobes somewhat like those of the eastern or swamp scarlet
paint-brush (<i>Castilleja coccinea</i>), which has similar flower clusters but
grows in swampy places.</p>
<p>The castillejas are mostly Western American plants, some being
parasitic on the roots of other plants. They are named in honor of
D. Castillejo, a Spanish botanist. In addition to the scarlet and purple
paint-brushes, several other castillejas are found in the state. Lindheimer&rsquo;s
paint-brush (<i>Castilleja lindheimeri</i>) is very much like the
purple paint-brush, but it has red or orange bracts. It is a perennial
plant which grows on limestone hillsides of Southwest-central Texas.
The woolly-stemmed paint-brush (<i>Castilleja lanata</i>) has woolly-gray
stems and leaves and red flower clusters. It may be noticed in chaparral
thickets and canyons in West Texas.</p>

slender-stalked flower clusters. The corollas are a pale lavender,
about an inch long. This is a very common plant in the state and has
been given various names by botanists, the latest one being <i>laxiflorus</i>.
It is a close relative, probably a variety, of the slender beard-tongue
(<i>Pentstemon gracilis</i>) of moist prairies from Minnesota to Oklahoma.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Texas Toad-Flax</span> (<i>Linaria texana</i>) has pale blue flowers similar
to those of the Canada toad-flax. The corollas have a slender spur

from a cluster of basal leaves which are finely divided into somewhat
rounded segments. It is widespread in sandy soil from Florida to
California and blooms early in the spring.</p>
<p>Many other figworts are found in the state. The nearest relative

Several erect stems from perennial roots grow on the rocky slopes of
prairies from Texas to Missouri and Kansas. It blooms in Texas in
April and May.</p>
<p>The flowering spikes of bell-shaped flowers are large and showy.
The corollas are usually pale, tinged with reddish-purple and marked
with darker lines. The fifth stamen is sparingly bearded. The stems
are 1-1&frac12; feet high, and the flowers are 1&frac12;-2 inches long. The
leaves are broad and partly clasping at the base, the margins usually
indented with sharp teeth. It is thought that the common garden

plants are three feet high, the reddish stems having a few opposite,
clasping leaves, those on the upper part being united and cup-shaped.
The foliage is very smooth and has a somewhat downy covering.</p>
<p>The flowering upper portion of the stem is often over a foot long
and bears a profusion of tubular scarlet flowers about an inch long.
The stamens extend beyond the corolla, and the fifth stamen is not
bearded. The long slender style remains on the capsule long after the
corollas have fallen away. The flowers usually bloom the latter part
of March in South Texas and the middle of April in North Texas.
The plants are quite hardy and may be successfully transplanted or
grown from seeds, but should be planted in sandy soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pentstemon&rdquo; is Greek meaning &ldquo;five stamens.&rdquo; Nearly all members
of the figwort family have only four stamens, but the pentstemons have
five; however, the fifth stamen does not bear a pollen-sac and is often
bearded. &ldquo;Beard-tongue&rdquo; refers to this bearded stamen. There are
nearly a hundred and fifty species of pentstemons, about thirty of
them being found in Texas. With the exception of one found in Southeastern
Asia, they are all North American plants.</p>
<p>Murray&rsquo;s pentstemon is quite similar to two red-flowered pentstemons
of the mountains of West Texas. These two are likewise tall,
vigorous plants and have showy clusters of flowers. Torrey&rsquo;s
pentstemon (<i>Pentstemon barbatus torreyi</i>) has narrow pointed leaves,
and the superb pentstemon (<i>Pentstemon superbus</i>) has broad oblong

trumpet-shaped flowers are about two inches long. White and pale-lavender
forms occur. It is a shrub or small tree frequently cultivated
for ornament in Texas and California. It blooms from May through
the summer months. Mexicans use the wood for fence-posts and the
branches for baskets. A tea made from the flowers is used as a remedy
for heart and lung diseases.</p>
<p>Several other members of this family are native to the state and are

<p><span class="sc">Flame Acanthus</span> (<i>Anisacanthus wrightii</i>) is covered with scarlet
flowers from early summer until frost. It is a low, widely branched
shrub, about 2 feet high, found in rocky soil of the mountains of
West Texas. The corollas have a narrow tube and five narrow, spreading
lobes which are nearly equal but somewhat 2-lipped. The two
stamens and the style extend beyond the corolla. The small leaves
are ovate-lanceolate in shape and are 1-2 inches long.</p>
<p>The flame acanthus is an excellent garden shrub for dry regions and
has been known in cultivation for some time. This species is named
in honor of Charles Wright, an early collector of Texas plants and one
of the first teachers in the state. Wright was a Yale graduate who
collected plants in Texas from 1837 to 1852 for Dr. Asa Gray of
Harvard University. He accompanied a baggage train to El Paso in
1849, and in 1851 he joined the Graham Boundary Survey. On both

<p><span class="sc">Wild Petunia.</span> <span class="sc">Ruellia</span> (<i>Ruellia nudiflora</i>) has flowers very much
like those of the cultivated petunia, a member of the potato family.
It is a very common plant in Central and South Texas, growing in
open woods or on rich prairies. It frequently takes possession of
lawns and flower beds.</p>
<p>The plants are erect, 12-16 inches high, and have few branches.
The few leaves are oval, narrowed at the base, wavy-margined, and
blunt or rounded at the apex. The forking flower clusters have one
to five flowers open at the same time. The flowers do not last very
long. Leaves and stem are often marked with red or purple.</p>
<p>The delicate, funnel-shaped corollas have five spreading lobes and
are about two inches long. The four stamens are inclosed in the tube.
The seed-capsules are nearly an inch long and turn brown as they
mature.</p>
<p>This ruellia was formerly confused with <i>Ruellia tuberosa</i>, a tropical
plant with tuberous roots. The ruellias belong to a large group of
plants with about 200 species most of which are found in tropical
South America. They are named for Jean de la Ruelle, an early
French physician and botanist.</p>
<p>There are several other ruellias widely distributed in the wooded
sections of the state. The hairy ruellia (<i>Ruellia ciliosa</i>) is abundant
on the prairies in Texas and the Eastern States. Miss Eaton, in an
article in the <i>National Geographic</i> in 1925, reports that carpenter-bees
use circular pieces of the corolla to plug off their nesting cells made in
tunnels in soft wood. Drummond&rsquo;s ruellia (<i>Ruellia drummondiana</i>) is

division.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tallow-Weed.</span> <span class="sc">Wright&rsquo;s Plantain</span> (<i>Plantago wrightiana</i>) is a
common plant on prairies from Texas to Arizona and blooms from
April to June. It is called tallow-weed because cattle fatten on the
plants. The stems are 6-8 in. high, and the numerous basal leaves
are half as long, narrow, smooth, and dark green. The small 4-lobed
flowers have a stiff, papery white corolla with spreading lobes. The
small capsules open by a lid.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Red-Seeded Plantain</span> or <span class="sc">Ribwort</span> (<i>Plantago rhodosperma</i>) has
broad leaves, 3-5-ribbed, and narrow spikes of flowers. The leaf-rosettes
are often a foot broad. The corolla lobes are erect and are
closed over one another. The ribwort is a very common weed in
sandy soil from Missouri to Texas and Arizona.</p>
<p>There are many other plantains in the state, all more or less abundant.
The group has retained the old Latin name. Scilla-seed, a
laxative in recent use, is obtained from a South American plantain.
The seeds of the lance-leaved plantain are sold as food for birds.</p>

<p class="bq">Leaves opposite or whorled; in ours, sepals and petals usually 4,
but may be 4-10, calyx joining ovary wall; stamens 4-10, on
corolla-tube; ovary inferior, 2-5-celled.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Small Bluet</span> (<i>Houstonia patens</i>) has violet-blue flowers which are
among the first blossoms of spring. They dot golf courses and sandy
meadows from Texas to Virginia and Illinois in February and March.
The bluets are also called innocence and angel-eyes.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Least Bluet</span> (<i>Houstonia minima</i>) is a smaller plant than the small
bluet, but the flowers are a little larger and are pale pink. They
bloom at the same time of year and may often be found together.
The least bluet ranges from Texas to Illinois and Kansas.</p>
<p>The madder-family is mainly tropical but is represented in Texas by
nearly forty species. Nearly all of these have inconspicuous, 4-lobed
white flowers and include many bedstraws and bluets, the button-weed,
and button-bush. From some members of the family valuable commercial
products&mdash;coffee, quinine, and a red dye&mdash;are obtained; the
cape-jasmine or gardenia is a well-known ornamental plant.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Baby&rsquo;s Breath.</span> <span class="sc">Narrow-Leaved Houstonia</span> (<i>Houstonia angustifolia</i>)
is not the garden plant (<i>Gypsophila paniculata</i>) which is known
as baby&rsquo;s breath, but it is equally dainty. The stems grow from woody
perennial roots and form erect clumps about a foot high. The small
flowers are borne in flat-topped clusters and vary in color from white
to pale pink or lavender. This plant is widely distributed on prairies
from Illinois to Texas and Florida.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bouvardia</span> (<i>Bouvardia ternifolia</i>) is a low shrub, 2-6 ft. high, which
grows in the mountains west of the Pecos River to Arizona and Mexico.
The leaves are short and grow in whorls of 3&rsquo;s or 4&rsquo;s. The narrow,
red tubular flowers are about one inch long. The Bouvardias were
once popular as greenhouse plants but are little used now. This one
was introduced into England more than one hundred years ago.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Southern Woodbine.</span> <span class="sc">Coral</span> or <span class="sc">Trumpet Honeysuckle</span> (<i>Lonicera
sempervirens</i>) is quite common in the woods of East Texas and other
Southern States, blooming in Texas in late March and continuing
until fall. It is an evergreen vine that has been widely introduced
into cultivation. The flowers are not so conspicuously two-lipped
as in the white honeysuckle, the corolla-lobes being nearly equal. The
scarlet berries are &frac14; inch long, ripening in the summer. This is one
of a number of plants which are commonly called woodbine. The
group was named in honor of Adam Lonitzer, an early German botanist.</p>
<p>The black haw (<i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>) is very abundant in Texas
woods. The showy ball-like clusters of white flowers appear with the
leaves in April and May, following the dogwood and red haws. The
American elder (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) is found along streams in
Central and East Texas.</p>

<p class="caption">WHITE HONEYSUCKLE</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">White Honeysuckle</span> (<i>Lonicera albiflora</i>) is a straggling bush which
usually grows in the shelter of a tree. The pale broad, oval leaves are
opposite and united at their bases, the uppermost pair being cup-shaped
and surrounding the cluster of flowers borne at the tip of the
stem. The fragrant flowers are less than an inch long with a narrow
tube and 5 lobes, the lower lobe long and narrow and the 4 upper
shorter, very much like those of the common cultivated Japanese
honeysuckle. The five spreading stamens extend conspicuously beyond
the corolla.</p>
<p>This plant blooms in April and May. It is scattered throughout
the central and western parts of the state, being especially abundant
in the western mountains, and ranges to Arkansas and Arizona. The
Japanese honeysuckle has escaped cultivation in places along the
bayous of East Texas.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lamb&rsquo;s Lettuce.</span> <span class="sc">Texas</span> or <span class="sc">Dwarf Corn Salad</span> (<i>Valerianella
amarella</i>) is one of the first white-flowered spring plants, growing in
such abundance that the prairies are white with the blooms. It is a
much smaller plant than the dwarf Queen Anne&rsquo;s lace which is so
lovely late in April and May. In the field it is usually about 6 in.
high but grows a little higher in cultivation when used as a border
plant. It is easily identified by its flat-topped clusters of flowers
grouped in squares at the end of the widely forking branches. The
smooth foliage is yellow-green in color.</p>
<p>There are several corn salads which grow in moist places in the
state. The dwarf corn salad may readily be distinguished from these,
as its minute seed-pod is covered with woolly hairs. The European
corn salad is cultivated, and the leaves are used for salad.</p>

<h3>GOURD FAMILY (Cucurbitaceae)</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig139">

<p class="bq">Tendrils mostly present, stems often prostrate; flowers usually
unisexual; calyx tubular, 5-lobed; petals united or separate; stamens
usually 3, one anther always 1-celled, the other two 2-celled;
ovary inferior.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wild Balsam Gourd</span> (<i>Ibervillea lindheimeri</i>) has bright scarlet
balls about an inch in diameter and makes conspicuous spots of color
on fences in the fall. The vine is slender, bearing small yellow flowers
in the spring. The fruits are green at first, turning orange and then a
scarlet red. Sometimes they are a little longer than broad and
pointed at the end. The few leaves are thick and deeply 3-5-lobed.
It ranges from Texas to California.</p>
<p>The garden balsam (<i>Impatiens balsamina</i>) bears no relation to this
plant. The vines in cultivation known as balsam apple and balsam
pear are, however, members of the gourd family and were introduced
from the Old World tropics. Watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers,
squashes, pumpkins, and gourds are well-known members of the gourd
family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>

<p class="caption">WILD GOURD</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Wild Gourd.</span> <span class="sc">Mock Orange</span> (<i>Cucurbita foetidissima</i>) has long
trailing stems which are often 15 feet long and may be 25 feet long.
It is readily distinguished by its large gray-green triangular leaves
which are somewhat 3-5-lobed. The leaf-blades are 4-12 inches long,
and the leaf-stalk is about half the length of the blade. The star-shaped
yellow flowers, about three inches broad, are almost hidden by
the leaves, the staminate and pistillate flowers being borne on different
plants.</p>
<p>The ovoid gourds, which at first are green variegated with a lighter
green, turn quite yellow at maturity. The resemblance of the yellow
fruit to oranges has given rise to the common name, mock orange.
The gourds are about three inches long. They are not edible, as the
pulp is fibrous and bitter. Mexicans use the plant as a soap substitute
by mashing the gourds or the roots in water. They call it
&ldquo;chilicoyote&rdquo; or &ldquo;calabacilla.&rdquo; The pumpkins and squashes, whose
origin is somewhat obscure, are close relatives of the gourd.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Venus&rsquo; Looking-Glass</span> (<i>Specularia perfoliata</i>) is a very common
American plant blooming in Texas in the early spring. Like the later
flowers of many violets, the first flowers never open and are self-fertilized.
The later flowers have a showy 5-lobed purple corolla about
an inch long. The seeds are dispersed from a small opening in the
lower part of the capsule. The leaves are small and clasping, usually
broader than long.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Western Venus&rsquo; Looking-Glass</span> (<i>Specularia leptocarpa</i>) has
flowers very much like the preceding, but the stamens and calyx lobes
are longer. The long, slender capsules have the opening pore near
the top. The showy flowers appear in late April and May. This
plant is abundant on the northern prairies of Texas and ranges to
Missouri and Montana.</p>

the rarer plants in the state, and care should be taken to preserve it.
It is lovely against the granite rocks and boulders of Central Texas.
The dainty, slender plants are often much branched and have blue
flowers about half an inch long. The bluebell of Scotland is a renowned
member of the group; Canterbury bells and the balloon-flower
are well-known in gardens.</p>
<h3>LOBELIA FAMILY (Lobeliaceae)</h3>
<p class="bq">Juice often milky; sepals 5; corolla 1-2-lipped, united; stamens
5, anthers joined into a tube.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Prairie Lobelia</span> (<i>Lobelia brachypoda</i>) grows on sandy prairies in
Southern Texas and the adjacent part of Mexico. It is very abundant
west of Falfurrias in March. The Texas lobelias may usually be
recognized by the five united stamens which have gray anthers bearded
at the top. The plants often have a milky sap containing a poisonous
alkaloid which is used in medicine. The red cardinal flower (<i>Lobelia
splendens</i>) is rather widely scattered in moist places throughout the
state but is rare enough to need protection.</p>

<p class="bq">Flowers crowded into heads surrounded by bracts; outer flowers
often strap-shaped and are called ray flowers; inner flowers are
tubular and are called disk flowers; sometimes flowers are all of
one type; calyx usually modified into bristles or awns (pappus);
petals united, tubular, 4-5-lobed; stamens 5, anthers united into a
tube; styles 2-lobed; ovary 1-celled, inferior. (See <a href="#Page_xii">p. xii</a>.)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Baldwin&rsquo;s Ironweed</span> (<i>Vernonia baldwinii</i>) has broad, flat-topped
clusters of purple heads. It forms a pleasing contrast to the abundant
yellow flowers of the summer months. The plant is a hardy perennial
and grows in ditches and river bottoms from Central Texas to Iowa.
The stems are 3-4 feet high and conspicuously leafy. The ironweeds
get their common name from the fact that the stems are very hard
and difficult for farmers to chop down.</p>
<p>About one-fifth of the plants found in Texas belong to the composite
family. It is generally divided into groups or tribes, the more important
being the ironweed, mist-flower, aster, everlasting, sunflower,
bitterweed, dog-fennel, and thistle groups. The composites in this
book are grouped together in tribes in the above order, but the tribes
are not separated or differentiated. Identification of composites is
much easier if the resemblance to a particular group can be noted.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Bluff Thoroughwort</span> (<i>Eupatorium ageratifolium</i>) is a widely
branched shrub of the rocky hillsides of Central and West Texas. The
bushes are covered with flat-topped clusters of pale-pink or white
flowers. The long, protruding styles, which are divided into two
recurved parts, have given the name of mist-flower to this and other
plants of the group.</p>
<p>Milk-sick plant (<i>Eupatorium ageratoides</i>) is a closely related plant
which causes in cattle a disease called &ldquo;trembles.&rdquo; The milk from
affected cows will cause sickness and death among humans. The late-flowering
thoroughwort (<i>Eupatorium serotinum</i>) is very abundant in
river bottoms throughout the state. Yankee-weed (<i>Eupatorium
compositifolium</i>) grows in big feathery clumps often 10 feet high.
It is a pernicious weed in East Texas and soon covers cut-over pine
lands. The dried flower-tops of several species were used by pioneers
as fever medicines. One of these plants was called Joe-pye weed in
honor of the Indian doctor, Joe Pye.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Blue Mist-Flower</span> (<i>Conoclinium coelestinum</i>) is sometimes called

<p><span class="sc">Prairie Blazing Star.</span> <span class="sc">Button Snakeroot</span> (<i>Laciniaria punctata</i>)
is sometimes called liatris from the scientific group to which these
plants are sometimes referred. A similar prairie blazing star is called
gay-feather. On the dry prairies in the western part of the state the
blazing star has short stems and short spikes of flowers; but where
moisture is more abundant, the plants are one to two feet high. The
plant does well in cultivation and is easily grown from the seed. It
ranges from Southern Canada to Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>The stems are closely covered with the narrow leaves, which are
marked with minute glandular dots. The spikes are densely covered
with long, narrow heads of purple flowers. There are only a few
star-shaped tubular flowers in a head. The seeds are widely scattered
by their crown of plumose bristles. The lovely spikes are often dried
for winter bouquets.</p>
<p>Many eastern blazing stars are found in the woods of East Texas,
where they make showy displays from July to October. They are
called snakeroots from their reputed property of curing snake-bites.
A tea made from the plant will cause profuse perspiration; the perspiration
was probably responsible for the reported snake-bite cures.
They are also called devil&rsquo;s bit or devil&rsquo;s bite, because of the bitten-off
appearance of the rootstock. The rootstock was considered such a
powerful remedy for human ills that the devil bit off a part for spite.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tall Goldenrod</span> (<i>Solidago altissima</i>) grows 2-8 ft. high, has rough
leaves which are sharply toothed and prominently triple-nerved, and

in dry soil from Maine to Nebraska and Texas.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gray</span>, <span class="sc">Field</span>, or <span class="sc">Dwarf Goldenrod</span> (<i>Solidago nemoralis</i>) has flower

one of the most abundant goldenrods in the central and western parts
of the state from July to November and ranges from Canada to Florida
and Arizona.</p>
<p>In Texas the goldenrods are usually found only in moist soil, many

<p><span class="sc">Stiff</span> or <span class="sc">Hard-Leaved Goldenrod</span> (<i>Solidago rigida</i>) is one of about
thirty-five goldenrods found in the state. It belongs to the type which
is responsible for the common name, as the yellow flowers are in heads
arranged in rod-like clusters at the top of the stem. The scientific
name of &ldquo;Solidago,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;to make whole,&rdquo; had its origin in the
healing properties of certain species.</p>
<p>The stiff goldenrod grows in dry rocky or sandy soil east of the
Rocky Mountains from Southern Canada to Texas. It grows 1&frac12;-2
feet high and has broad leaves 1-2 inches long. Lindheimer&rsquo;s goldenrod
(<i>Solidago lindheimeriana</i>) is a similar stout, leafy-stemmed plant
which is abundant in Central Texas and ranges to Kansas and Mexico.
Bigelow&rsquo;s goldenrod (<i>Solidago bigelovii</i>) is another species with rod-like
clusters. It is found in the mountainous regions of West Texas and
New Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Broom-Weed.</span> <span class="sc">Kindling-Weed</span> (<i>Amphiachyris dracunculoides</i>) is a
pasture pest in the southern part of the Great Plains region. The
slender stem is unbranched near the base, but above the middle the
numerous spreading branches form a flat-topped plant which bears
many small heads of yellow flowers. The plants are often 2-4 feet
high and grow in dense masses. It has been used as a broom by early
settlers, Mexicans, and children at play. The resinous foliage of the
dried plants was also highly valued for kindling fires.</p>
<p>The broom-weed is closely related to the rabbit-brush which is so
abundant in West Texas and New Mexico. The Texas rabbit-brush
(<i>Gutierrezia texana</i>) of West Texas is so much like the broom-weed
that only a close observer can distinguish them. Both have 5-8

the farmer. The plants often grow 3 feet high and are much branched,
bearing heads of golden-yellow flowers nearly an inch across. The
upper leaves are broad and clasping, but the lower are narrowed at
the base. The scientific name refers to the dissimilar fruits of the
ray and disk flowers, those of the ray flowers having no bristles. It
ranges from Delaware to Arizona and Mexico.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Texas Gumweed</span> (<i>Grindelia texana</i>) belongs to a group easily

This one is common on rocky limestone slopes in Central Texas in
the fall and ranges to Southwest Missouri. The wand-like stems,
covered with the overlapping leaves, are topped by large heads of

September. It ranges north to Kansas and Missouri. The stems are
topped by short clusters of large heads, 2-3 inches broad. The leaves
are thick, gummy, and closely beset with bristle-tipped teeth. Sometimes
an injury to the stem may cause it to become widely branched.</p>
<p>The scientific name means &ldquo;resembling a saw&rdquo; and refers to the

<p><span class="sc">White Lazy Daisy</span> (<i>Aphanostephus skirrobasis</i>) grows very abundantly
in sandy soil in spring and summer. It ranges from Kansas to
Mexico and Florida. The morning traveller does not appreciate its
beauty, for it is truly a lazy daisy, not opening its heads until nearly
noon. The plants are usually branched and grow 6-18 inches high.
The large, showy heads are 1-2 inches across and are usually long-stalked.
Unlike those of many other daisies, the seeds are not topped
by slender bristles but have an inconspicuous crown, as is denoted by
the scientific name, which is Greek for &ldquo;faint crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Oak-Leaved Fleabane Daisy</span> (<i>Erigeron quercifolius</i>) is very abundant
in the spring in the East Texas woods and ranges through the
Southern States. The lower leaves resemble oak leaves, but those on
the stem are narrow and pointed. The numerous fleabane daisies in
the state may be readily recognized by means of the many, very
narrow ray flowers which are usually white, pale pink, or pale
lavender. Kiss-me-and-I&rsquo;ll-tell-you (<i>Erigeron annuus</i>) is a taller
daisy and is very abundant in East Texas.</p>

showy of the asters but is very abundant in Texas. It ranges from
Kansas to Texas and Florida. The white, daisy-like heads may be
noted against the dark-green foliage in roadside ditches, or it may
appear as a violet haze along the highway. Although it is considered
one of the common lawn pests in the fall, yet even there it is a thing
of beauty; for when the slender stems are cut, numerous branches
spread out from the base, and soon the grass is studded with the tiny
white or lavender heads. Keepers of bees on the coastal prairie
highly prize it as the source of their most palatable honey.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Spiny Aster</span> (<i>Aster spinosus</i>) is quite similar to the roadside aster

<p><span class="sc">Narrow-Leaved Baccharis.</span> <span class="sc">Oil Willow</span> (<i>Baccharis angustifolia</i>)
looks very much like the black willow, to which, however, it bears

the flowers appear in the late summer and fall. The pollen-bearing
flowers are not borne on the same shrub with the seed-bearing flowers.
The flowers, all small, inconspicuous, whitish, and tubular, are borne
in a narrow head of ovate bracts which soon turn brown.</p>
<p>It is called the oil willow by some of the older residents because it
is said to be an indicator of oil, just as the black willow is said to be
a good indicator of water. It is also called brittle willow, false willow,
and resin willow. It grows in brackish marshes throughout the state
and may be found eastward to North Carolina. The soft white plumy
bristles on the seed give the shrub the feathery appearance of the
Yankee-weed. Along the coast in the southeastern part, the groundsel-tree

suitable name for them in the sheep-grazing section of Central Texas
which has been heavily over-grazed. In many pastures they take the
place of grasses as a ground cover. The leaves may be chewed for
gum. The rabbit tobacco is closely related to the cudweeds and

Mexican hat, niggertoe, &ldquo;gallitos,&rdquo; long-headed or prairie cone-flower,
and black-eyed Susan, though the last term is erroneously used. It
is a very handsome plant, which is widely distributed on plains from
Southern Canada to Arizona, Texas, and Tennessee. In South Texas
it is at its best in April and May; in North Texas it is lovely in late
May and June.</p>
<p>Numerous erect stems grow from a woody perennial root and are
commonly two to two and a half feet high. The long-stalked heads
terminate the branches. The leaves are finely divided into long narrow
segments, both leaves and stem being somewhat rough.</p>
<p>The showy flowers have drooping, velvety rays which are entirely
yellow or reddish-brown or partly colored yellow and brown. The
small tubular flowers are brown and are borne on a thimble-shaped
or columnar disk which varies greatly in size on different flowers,
sometimes being nearly two inches long, but it is usually about an
inch long. The disk is gray-green before the flowers open.</p>
<p>The dwarf niggerhead (<i>Ratibida tagetes</i>) is quite similar to the
large niggerhead in growth habit and coloring, but it is a smaller
plant and has smaller flowers. It is found from Kansas to Mexico
on dry plains and blooms a month later than the large niggerhead.</p>
<p>The niggerhead belongs to a small group of showy American plants.
It was introduced into European gardens many years ago, whence
it later made its way back to American gardens. The niggerhead
group is closely related to the black-eyed Susan and other cone-flowers.

the ray flowers are not marked with a brown spot at the base
and are divided into three equal lobes at the tip. The ray flowers
of the coreopsis are commonly divided into four lobes, the two lateral

into long, narrow segments.</p>
<p>This is one of the most widely distributed plants on the prairies
from Mexico to Colorado, South Dakota, and Missouri. The yellow

which are much broader than long and are conspicuously three-lobed.
The heads are densely clustered on short branches at the top of the
stems, which are from six inches to two feet high.</p>
<p>Near El Paso is found the lovely western paper-flower or Cooper&rsquo;s
psilostrophe (<i>Psilostrophe cooperi</i>). It grows in spreading clumps
about two feet broad and bears long-stalked heads over an inch wide.
As the flowers are bright yellow and remain lovely for months, they
are often gathered for winter bouquets. Eventually they become
white and papery. <i>Psilostrophe tagetinae</i> has somewhat larger flowers
than the plains paper-flower and is probably the most abundant paper-flower

vivid red and yellow in April, May, and early June when the firewheels
are in bloom. It is a highly-prized cultivated plant, and many
varieties have been developed. There are several species of gaillardias
and many of them are native to Texas. The beautiful one is the
most widespread, ranging from Texas to Louisiana, Nebraska, Arizona,
and Mexico. The gaillardias are named for a French botanist, Gaillard.</p>
<p>The heads are usually two or three inches across and are long-stalked.
Each head has 10-20 broad ray flowers which are sometimes
all red but usually are marked with a brilliant yellow across the
three lobes. The upper leaves are lance-shaped, and the lower are
oblong and marked with a few teeth or lobes. It is an annual plant
which is widely branched and grows one to one and a half feet high.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Tiny Tim.</span> <span class="sc">Spreading Thyme-Leaf</span> (<i>Thymophylla polychaeta</i>)
is found on sandy prairies from South Texas to Mexico and New
Mexico. There are several thyme-leaf species in the state. They
may be recognized by their scented foliage and the cup-like base of
the flower heads, the bracts of the head being marked with large
yellow or orange glands. There is something appealing about the
tiny Tim, as the name would indicate. The branching stems with
their lacy green leaves form rosettes which are dotted with the yellow
daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dwarf Thyme-Leaf.</span> <span class="sc">Tiny Tim</span> (<i>Thymophylla pentachaeta</i>) clings
to cliffs and rocky hillsides. It is a perennial plant with short stems
four to six inches high. The leaves are short and needle-like and are
borne in dense clusters around the stem. The flower heads are about
half an inch broad. Tiny Tim ranges from Texas to Arizona and
Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dog Fennel.</span> <span class="sc">Mayweed.</span> <span class="sc">Dog&rsquo;s Camomile</span> (<i>Anthemis cotulla</i>) is
a strong-scented herb widely scattered in America, naturalized from
Europe. It is very abundant in sandy soil in the eastern part of the
state. The plants are widely branched and bear numerous heads
about an inch broad. The rays are broad and wide and the disk
flowers are yellow. It begins to bloom in Texas in March, but the
plants are at their best in May and June. It is close kin to the European
camomile, which is used medicinally, a soothing tea being
made from the dried ball-shaped heads of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Closely related to camomile and yarrow are the artemisias, which
include many species known as dusty miller, wormwood, sage-brush,
and purple sage. The silvery wormwood or thread-leaved sage-brush
(<i>Artemisia filifolius</i>) is very abundant in the sandy areas of West
Texas and throughout the Rocky Mountain States and Mexico. It
blooms from July to October.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Yarrow.</span> <span class="sc">Woods Milfoil</span> (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>) was named in
honor of Achilles, to whom is attributed the discovery of its healing
properties. It is supposed to stop bleeding, relieve spasms, produce
sweating, and act as a tonic. The woods milfoil is widely distributed
in woods in the United States, Europe, and Asia. It makes a nice
garden plant, for the lacy fern-like leaves remain green all winter.
The stems grow one to two feet high and are topped by the flat
flower-cluster. The ray flowers are white or sometimes pale pink or
lavender, and the disk flowers are pale yellow.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Plains Yarrow.</span> <span class="sc">Woolly Milfoil</span> (<i>Achillea lanulosa</i>) grows in
moist places on the plains from Texas to Canada, Mexico, and California.
It is very much like the woods yarrow but differs in that it
has fewer gray-green leaves and round-topped flower clusters. Its
blooming season is a little later than that of the woods yarrow, which
blooms in April and May.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Texas Squaw-Weed.</span> <span class="sc">Clasping-Leaved Groundsel</span> (<i>Senecio ampullaceus</i>)
is an annual plant which grows so abundantly on the sandy
prairies of Texas that it forms a carpet of gold for miles and miles.
It is one of the earliest spring flowers to bloom in such showy profusion.
The plants commonly grow 1&frac12;-2 feet high, being branched
above and forming flat-topped flower-clusters which are often a foot
broad. When quite young, the plants are densely white-woolly but
become smooth and shining with age. The irregularly toothed leaves
are 3-6 inches long and have a broad clasping base. The groundsel
belongs to one of our largest groups of plants, some 1200 species
being widely distributed over the earth.</p>
<p>Fine-leaved or woolly groundsel (<i>Senecio filifolius</i>) has woolly leaves
divided into narrow segments. The large heads are often in bloom
throughout the year in West Texas and New Mexico.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p><span class="sc">American Star Thistle.</span> <span class="sc">Basket Flower</span> (<i>Centaurea americana</i>)
is often called spineless thistle because the leaves do not bear spines
as do the leaves of its close relative, the purple thistle. It is also
known as powder puffs, sweet sultan, and &ldquo;cardo del valle.&rdquo; It is a
hardy annual which is widely cultivated. Basket flower is the name
under which it is known in cultivation&mdash;a name which refers to the
stiff, straw-colored bracts of the flower head. These bracts are not
spiny but are divided at the tip into finger-like projections.</p>
<p>Before the flowers are fully opened, the heads resemble a shaving-brush,
and this is a common name frequently applied to this and
other thistles. All the flowers are tubular and divided into five long
narrow lobes. In one variety the fully-opened flower cluster has an
outer border of numerous lavender flowers with cream-colored flowers
in the center. There is another variety which has outer flowers a
deep rose or reddish purple and center flowers pale pink or rose;
sometimes there is little difference in shade between the inner and
outer flowers.</p>
<p>The stems are usually branched and grow about two feet high.
They are marked with wing-like ridges and are covered with the
overlapping, ascending leaves. In Texas the flowers begin to bloom
in May and continue into June, being at their best the first week
in June. After the flowering season, the foliage becomes yellow and
dried, and the old stalks remain conspicuous in the fields for several
months. The star thistle is found on plains from Missouri to Louisiana,
Mexico, and Arizona. The variety which has reddish-purple
flowers is very abundant in the vicinity of Waco and Fort Worth.</p>
<p>The scientific name meaning &ldquo;of the Centaurs&rdquo; refers to the use
by the Centaurs of certain species for healing. The cornflower or
bachelor&rsquo;s button (<i>Centaurea cyanus</i>) is a well-known garden annual.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Wavy-Leaved Thistle</span> (<i>Carduus undulatus</i>) is the common prairie
thistle and is particularly abundant in the vicinity of Fort Worth. It
grows only 1-2 feet high, and the upper leaf-surfaces are yellow-green.
The heads are nearly twice as large as those of the purple thistle, and
the flowers are a lovely lavender color. It ranges from Southern
Canada to Texas and Arizona and blooms in Texas from April to
June.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Purple Thistle</span> (<i>Carduus austrinus</i>) is the common thistle in the
south-central part of the state. It is a tall, much branched plant,
3-4 feet high, with long-stalked heads of purple flowers. The stems
are white-woolly, and the leaves are white-felty beneath and dark-green
above, wavy-margined, lobed or divided, the segments being
tipped with spines. The heads are about 1&frac12; inches high and broad.
The numerous light purple flowers are all tubular with narrow lobes.
The thistles belong to a large group, its most renowned representative
being the Scotch thistle.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Nodding Thistle.</span> <span class="sc">Silver Puffs.</span> <span class="sc">Sunbonnet Babies</span> (<i>Thrysanthema
nutans</i>) lacks the spines of the true thistles, but other characters
show that this interesting little plant is closely related to the
thistle group. The leaves form a basal rosette from which grows
the slender, leafless flowering stalk bearing the nodding flower head.
The lyre-shaped leaves are wavy-margined, dark-green above and
white-felty below, 2-4 inches long. The stalk is sometimes 15 inches
long but is commonly about 8 inches high. The creamy-white flowers
are rather inconspicuous, but as the seeds mature, the soft white
bristles spread into a showy whorl. The plants are found in scattered
places in rich soil from Central Texas to Mexico.</p>
<p>Closely kin to the nodding thistle is the desert holly (<i>Perezia nana</i>),
which has salmon-pink flowers and holly-like leaves. It is a low plant
seeking the shelter of creosote bush, yucca, and other shrubs in West
Texas.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Purple Dandelion.</span> <span class="sc">Flowering Straw</span> (<i>Lygodesmia texana</i>) can
nearly always be found in the prairie sections of the state from spring
to fall, but the lovely flowers seldom make a showy display along the
roadsides. Only one head blooms at a time on the slender forking
stems, and that remains open only in the mornings. The heads are
made up of 8-12 pale purple strap-shaped corollas, with the lavender
styles conspicuously erect in the center. The tip of the corolla is
divided into five minute lobes. The stems are almost leafless but
have a cluster of short-lobed, narrow gray-green leaves at the base.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Small-Flowered Straw</span> (<i>Ptiloria pauciflora</i>) is a white-flowered

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Many-Stemmed False Dandelion</span> (<i>Sitilias multicaulis</i>) has lemon-yellow
flower heads which closely resemble those of the true dandelion,
but the plants grow much taller and are often widely branched. From
early spring through June, the false dandelion is very abundant on
the coastal and western prairies. The heads are made up of several
rows of strap-shaped corollas. The fruits are narrow and have attached
a spreading tuft of bristles which makes the head in fruit
look like a puff ball of lace. This tuft is a parachute device for
scattering the seeds far and wide.</p>
<p><span class="sc">White Dandelion</span> (<i>Pinaropappus roseus</i>) has flower heads very
much like those of the yellow dandelions, but the flowers vary in color
from white to pale pink, and the heads are larger. It is very abundant
in March and April in Southwest-Central Texas.</p>
<p>Several garden plants belong to the chicory family, among them
being lettuce, salsify, and chicory. The orange hawkweed is often
cultivated for ornament.</p>

<p>The following lists are given to assist the reader in identifying
plants. Several special groupings are first given according to conditions
and habit of growth. If the plant sought does not qualify for these
lists, then the longer seasonal and color lists should be consulted. Several
wide-spread plants which the author had to omit because of lack of
space have been mentioned in the lists; these may be recognized by
the absence of a page reference. Several related species, not mentioned
in the text and which may be recognized as close relatives of
those illustrated although they may differ in color and season of
growth, have been included in the lists.</p>
<p>Opposite each name is given the number of the page on which the
plant is described and a symbol which designates the place of growth.
The section of the state is not given in the lists, as prairie plants
are much the same throughout the state as are the plants in the sandy
soil of post oak woods. However, climatic conditions of moisture and
temperature limit the range of many plants, and the text should be
consulted for the distributional range.</p>
<p>The time of flowering in Central Texas has been taken as the basis
for listing the plants according to seasonal distribution. Quite frequently
the season in North Texas will be a month later than that
of Central Texas, and in South Texas it will be a month earlier.
Hence it may be necessary to consult the lists for adjoining seasons
if the desired plant is not found in the first list to be checked. Some
plants, especially many herbaceous perennials on the western plains,
have flowering seasons in both spring and fall; others bloom throughout
the warmer months after heavy rains. If a plant cannot be located
in the fall list, the spring list should be consulted.</p>
<p>The month of April shows the greatest profusion of flowers in
nearly all parts of the state. At some of the wild flower exhibits
held at the University of Texas, nearly 500 species from Central and
Southeast Texas have been shown at one time. Therefore the reader
is warned not to expect to find every flower he picks up among the
257 illustrations given in these pages.</p>
<p>The plants are listed in the following color groups: red and orange,
pink and rose, blue, white, yellow, purple, and green. Under white
flowers are grouped those delicately tinted with green, yellow, blue,
pink, or lavender. Blue flowers are seldom a true blue but are usually
a combination of blue and purple which may be interpreted by some
people as blue and by others as purple. Hence if a plant considered
as blue-flowered cannot be found in the blue list, then the purple
list should be consulted.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
